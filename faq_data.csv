I am using RFEM 6 on an Apple Macintosh using Parallels Desktop. The axis cross is not displayed correctly in the graphic. How can this be corrected?,"Parallels Desktop provides a virtual machine on the Macintosh in which, for example, Windows 11 can be operated. RFEM 6 can also be installed in this virtual machine. The problem with the graphics representation points to a problem with OpenGL. Unfortunately, Parallels Desktop only supports the outdated OpenGL version 3.3. RFEM 6 requires at least OpenGL 4.2. The solution to the problem is to install the MESA drivers. RFEM is initially installed normally within the virtual machine. Then, in the virtual Windows environment, follow the instructions to enable the MESA software renderer from this FAQ: RFEM 6 should now run without any problems."
How can I use RFEM 6 / RSTAB 9 on an Apple Macintosh?,"RFEM 6 and RSTAB 9 is currently only available as a version for Microsoft Windows. Nevertheless, it is possible to run the Dlubal software on a modern Macintosh computer with an M1/M2 processor. We recommend using. Parallels Desktop is software that simulates virtual machines. A computer is represented by software in a virtual machine. Another guest operating system can run in such a virtual machine. To run RFEM / RSTAB on the Mac, we recommend installing Windows 11 as the guest operating system. Current Macs with M1/M2 processors require the Windows 11 version for ARM. Parallels Desktop immediately offers to install the appropriate operating system. In Parallels Desktop there is a so-called coherence mode. The individual Windows programs are then integrated into the macOS interface. In order to use the Dlubal software with Parallels Desktop, it is necessary to activate the MESA renderer. After installation, the resources for the virtual machine are quite economical. Only 8 GB of RAM is used for Windows. If slightly larger models are to be processed with RFEM / RSTAB, then the values should be increased. In order to be able to change the memory value, the virtual machine must first be shut down."
"Where can I find the working directory of RFEM 6, RSTAB 9 and RSECTION 1?","With the standard installation of the products RFEM 6, RSTAB 9 and RSECTION 1, the working directory is created under the following path: C:\Users\[your user name]\AppData\Local\Dlubal. Please note that the ""AppData"" folder is usually a hidden folder. This can also be reached by directly entering the path in Windows Explorer. The working directories of the individual programs are located in the corresponding subfolders. Here you will find, among other things, the local program configurations and the most recently used program instances."
Is the Tekla AddIn automatically installed in RFEM 6?,"No, the AddIn is not installed automatically. This means the user must have Tekla Structures and RFEM 6 installed on the computer. You then have to navigate to the following folder: * C:\Program Files\Dlubal\RFEM 6.02\tools\TeklaAddIn This contains the ""setup.exe"" file. This can now be executed simply by double-clicking. The Tekla AddIn installer opens. After completion, the addin is installed and the corresponding function is available in the Tekla ribbon. It should also be ensured that the server has been started in RFEM. This setting can be found in the RFEM menu ""Options"" under ""Program Options""."
How can I export or import an IFC file in RFEM 6 / RSTAB 9?,"File - Export and File - Import give you access to the commands for exporting and importing an IFC file. Version 4.0 is supported for import and export. The older version 2x3, however, only during import. Regardless of the direction in which you exchange data, the StructuralAnalysisView as well as the ReferenceView (Coordination View) can be processed."
How can parametric cross-sections be generated with a Python program?,"As with cross-sections from the library, this also works with the correct name.

I need to use custom parameters for methods of the Python High Level Library for RFEM in my Python program. How can I determine the necessary parameters?,"One possibility is to call this URL while RFEM is running: http://localhost:8082/wsdl The definition of the entire API is displayed as XML (see also WSDL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language). A pragmatic way to determine the parameters is, for example, to first compile the desired material in RFEM and then read out the properties. The following program shows the procedure: from RFEM.initModel import * Model(True, 'Material.rf6') Model.clientModel.service.begin_modification() m = Model.clientModel.service.get_material(1) print(m) Model.clientModel.service.finish_modification() Model.clientModel.service.close_connection() This method can be used for all objects in RFEM."
How can I create a nonlinear line hinge with a Python program?,"function for nonlinear line hinges is currently not available in the Python High Level Library. Since, as usual, user-defined parameters can be used in the method for line hinges, it is not a problem to create non-linear line hinges as well. In the sample program, 2 rectangular areas with nodal supports are first created, which are connected at line 6. The definition of the non-linear line hinge starts from line 39. First, a dictionary p is created with the parameters. 3 translational degrees of freedom and one rotational degree of freedom must be defined. The value 0.0 means that the freedom count is free. If a numerical value is written instead, this is interpreted as a spring. Note that SI base units are used here. With inf the degree of freedom is defined as fixed.

How do you use the 'bearing force transfer from another model' feature?,"==== Prerequisites ==== Two conditions must be met so that bearing forces can be taken over from other models: # Both models must be in the same project (same project ID) # Both models must have different model IDs. So that models have different IDs, each model must be created via ""File > New..."". Alternatively, an existing model can also be saved as a copy via ""File > Save as..."", this then also has a different ID. The ID's can be viewed in the basic data of a model. ==== Procedure ==== If the prerequisites are met, the check mark ""From support reaction..."" can be activated in the ""Child"" model in the menu for a nodal load. In the associated new tab, the ""mother"" model (model from which the load is to be taken), the load (load case/load combination) and the node of the nodal support must be specified. It should be noted that loads can be applied more than once. The position of the node also does not have to match that in the ""mother"" model. When the load has been applied, the value ""??"" appears first. The correct value is only displayed once the respective load case has been calculated. This calculation also triggers the calculation in the ""mother"" model. ==== Changes in the source model ==== If changes are made in the ""mother"" model, then the load in the ""child"" model is reset to ""??"" set when the ""mother"" model is saved. A recalculation of the load case in the ""child"" model adopts the new values."
I want to account for soil-structure interaction using one of the nonlinear soil material models. - Why does it not make sense to calculate individual load cases with this model?,"The specific soil material models have a variable stiffness that depends, among other things, on the prevailing stress level. In the analysis of a single load case, only this is imposed on the structure and the floor. It does not take into account any stress level from other loads that may be required to obtain and use the correct soil stiffness from the soil material model. The live load load case, for example, will cause different stiffnesses and thus deformations if it is applied as part of a load combination to a system that is stressed by soil self-weight and structure self-weight and structural load than if it is applied as the ""first/single"" load, as described in the analysis of the load case would take place. It therefore makes no sense to analyze soil with the specific soil material models under individual loads/load cases if at least the prevailing soil self-weight is not taken into account."
"I want to hide my area results for a certain range, around the value zero. How can I elegantly solve this in RFEM 6?","If only individual areas in a model are decisive for the design, the evaluation based on the isosurfaces can quickly become confusing. When displaying the results, RFEM 6 offers the option of activating gray areas. In this way, low-load areas are hidden and the spectrum of the color scale only shows the relevant surface areas. To activate it, select the ""Representation type"" -> ""Isosurfaces"" -> ""Gray zone"" area in the lower part of the result navigator and set the check there. Below this, a value between 0.1% and 50% can be selected, to which the gray zone should extend. This percentage value indicates the limits of the gray area, based on the absolute minimum and maximum of the active result variable."
How can I call up the calculation diagrams in RFEM 6 or RSTAB 9 after the calculation has been completed?,"During the calculation, the convergence diagram is displayed in the solver window of RFEM 6 and RSTAB 9. A new main group has been introduced for inserting and editing such calculation diagrams. This is located in the Data navigator below the Loads group. The calculation diagrams can also be called up in the result tables, provided that some have been defined. If you calculate a load case or a combination of several load levels, also activate saving of the results of all in the static analysis settings Load levels. Otherwise, only the results of the highest increment are displayed in the calculation diagram."
Is there a way to output the results of the resistance forces of all zones from RWIND in a table?,"In RWIND you have the option of defining zones and thus obtaining the drag force for these zones. The information is available to you graphically and for each individual zone. This is how you simply keep track of things. For complex structures, it can be helpful to quickly evaluate these results in tabular form. To do this, you can evaluate the results in ParaView. Unzip the RWIND file and open the Sim001_V01_Surface.vtp file in the RWIND_Simulations archive folder in ParaView. Since zones are defined in the RWIND file, you can generate a .csv file with the cell information. This .csv file contains information about the forces in the cells (front and back) related to the global axes. You can use Excel to sum up the forces of the zones and also form a vector. The information in ParaView is in SI units (for the forces [N])."

The cross sections from my imported IFC file are not converted correctly.,"In principle, IFC elements can be selected graphically. If you call up the context menu (click with the right mouse button), you can decide for each element whether it should be converted into a straight/curved bar, a surface or a solid. For the conversion of IFC elements into Dlubal elements (eg Dlubal cross-sections) the necessary information must be available. The following aspects must be checked for this. '''1. Allocation of the Dlubal names in the conversion table''' With the CAD-BIM menu bar you can call up the information on the respective IFC objects via the conversion tables. The information read from the IFC file is displayed in the first table column. Successfully read cross-sections are uniquely assigned to IFC objects. The Dlubal names in the table must be assigned accordingly for the conversion. These can easily be selected from the material and cross-section library. '''2. Cross-section designations cannot be read from the IFC file''' For some imported IFC files, no read cross-sections are displayed in the conversion table. The table column of the external cross-sections is empty. However, a cross-section designation is visible in the properties of the IFC elements. This means that the information about the cross-section is available in the IFC file, but it cannot be read by RFEM. In this case, you cannot carry out a conversion according to point 1. The external cross-sections cannot be added to the conversion table afterwards, as they are not assigned to an IFC element. These IFC elements can first be converted into beams in order to then adjust the cross-section of the beam."
"With my model, it is not possible to design double angles with the steel design add-on. There is always an indication of an invalid cross-section shape.","If it is a composite steel profile, the design for the combination type ""without interaction"" is not possible.

My model in RFEM 6 / RSTAB 9 is unstable. What could be the cause?,"calculation termination due to an unstable system can have various reasons. On the one hand, it can indicate a ""real"" instability due to system overload, but on the other hand, modeling inaccuracies can also be responsible for this error message. Below is one possible approach to find the cause of the instability. '''1. Control of the modelling''' First it should be checked whether the system is in order from the modeling point of view. For this purpose, it is advisable to use the model controls provided by RFEM 6 / RSTAB 9 (Extras → Model Control). These options can be used, for example, to find and, if necessary, delete identical nodes and overlapping members. You can also edit the structure e.g. B. under pure self-weight in a load case according to the first-order theory. If results are then output, the structure is stable in terms of modeling. If this is not the case, the most common causes are listed below: *'''Wrong definition of supports / lack of supports''' This can lead to instability because the system is not supported in all directions. Therefore it is necessary that the bearing conditions are in balance with the system as well as with the external boundary conditions. Statically underdetermined systems can also lead to calculation aborts due to a lack of boundary conditions. * '''Torsion of members around their own axis''' If members twist around their own axis, i.e. the member is not held around its own axis, this can lead to instabilities. The cause often lies in the settings of the rod end joints. It is possible that torsion joints were introduced both at the beginning and at the end node. * '''Missing connection of bars''' Especially with larger and more complex models, it can quickly happen that some bars are not connected to each other and thus ""float freely in the air"". Forgetting to cross bars that should actually intersect can also lead to instabilities. A remedy is provided by the ""Crossing, not connected members"" model check, which searches for members that cross but do not have a common node at the intersection. * '''No common knot''' The knots are apparently in the same place, but on closer inspection they differ minimally from each other. Frequent causes are CAD imports, which can be cleaned up using the model control. * '''Creation of a chain of hinges''' Too many member end hinges at a node can cause a chain of hinges, which leads to a calculation termination. Only n-1 joints with the same degree of freedom related to the global coordinate system may be defined per node, where ""n"" is the number of connected members. The same applies to line hinges. '''2. Checking the bracing''' Missing bracing also leads to aborted calculations due to instability. Therefore, it should always be checked whether the supporting structure is sufficiently stiffened in all directions. '''3. Numerical problems ''' The following example is given on this point. It is an articulated frame, which is reinforced by tension rods. Due to the shortening of the leg as a result of the vertical loads, the tension rods receive small compressive forces in the first calculation run. They will be removed from the system (since only train can be picked up). In the second calculation run, the model is then unstable without these tension rods. There are several ways to solve this problem. You can give the tension members a prestress (member load) to “eliminate” the small compressive forces, assign a small stiffness to the members, or have the members removed one by one in the calculation. The calculation setting is automated in RSTAB 9, in RFEM 6 this can be optionally activated. '''4. Finding the Cause of an Instability''' * '''Automatic Model Check with Graphical Output''' In order to obtain a graphic representation of the cause of an instability, the add-on Structural Stability for RFEM 6 / RSTAB 9[https://www.dlubal. com/de/products/add-ons-for-rfem-6-and-rstab-9/additional-analyses/structural-stability]. Supposedly unstable systems can be calculated with the option ""Calculate without loading for proof of instability by eigenmodes"". An eigenvalue analysis is carried out using the structural data so that the instability of the affected component is graphically displayed as a result. * '''Branch problem''' If load cases or load combinations can be calculated according to the 1st order theory and the calculation only stops from the 2nd order theory, then there is a stability problem (branch load factor less than 1.00). The critical load factor specifies the factor by which the load must be multiplied in order for the model to become unstable (e.g. buckle) under the associated load. It follows: A critical load factor smaller than 1.00 means that the system is unstable. Only a positive critical load factor greater than 1.00 allows the statement that the load due to the specified axial forces multiplied by this factor leads to buckling failure of the stable system. In order to be able to find the ""weak point"", the following procedure is recommended, which uses the add-on Structural Stability for RFEM 6 / RSTAB 9 https://www.dlubal.com/en/products/add-ons-fuer-rfem-6 -and-rstab-9/additional-analyses/structure-stability. First, the load of the affected load combination should be reduced until the load combination becomes stable. The load factor in the calculation parameters of the load combination serves as an aid. This also corresponds to a manual determination of the critical load factor if the add-on structure stability https://www.dlubal.com/de/produkte/add-ons-fuer-rfem-6-und-rstab-9/zusaetzliche-analysen/strukturstabilitaet is not available. For purely linear structural elements, it can be sufficient to calculate the load combination according to the first-order theory and select it directly in the additional module. Subsequently, based on this load combination, the buckling or buckling figure can be calculated and graphically displayed in the corresponding add-on module. The ""weak point"" in the system is identified through the graphical output and can then be specifically optimized."
"When importing a cross-section from RSECTION 1, I get an error message about the version. What can I do?","This error message is displayed when you use a newer version of RSECTION 1 than RFEM 6.

Make sure both versions are current."
My old model is suddenly unstable. What could be the reason?,"As of RFEM 5.27, there was an adjustment in the solver that should recognize articulated chains better, which can cause models in the newer versions to become unstable.

would like to determine and consider the stiffness in a line support using a fictitious wall. Why is this option greyed out for me?,"The ""Stiffness using fictitious wall"" option is only available if the local axis system of the supported line has been selected, not for the global coordinate system.

"When exporting my model from RFEM to RWIND, I get the message ""Warning No. 7731 | Reading the logger file failed"". What can I do to start the simulation in RWIND?","When using couplings/rigid members or members with a cross-section of the dummy rigid type, problems often occur when generating the model in RWIND. The program aborts with the warning message. You still have the option of carrying out a wind simulation for such structures. To do this, deactivate the visibility for the objects concerned, eg via the view navigator. Then the ""Only export active objects"" option must be activated in the ""Simulate and generate wind loads"" dialog under the ""Settings"" tab. The model can then either be opened in RWIND or simulated directly in the background."
How do you animate a load increase or a construction process?,"By defining load levels, the defined load level can be increased step by step, with iteration for each load level until equilibrium is found. This option is particularly useful for analysis according to Theory II. or III. Order relevant, since finding equilibrium often turns out to be difficult in the case of large deformations. A load increase can basically be defined in the static analysis settings. To do this, the static analysis settings must be opened and then only the number of load steps increased. In order to display the intermediate results of the individual load levels in addition to the final load factor, the intermediate results can be made visible with the ""Save results of all load increases"" function. In order to display these load steps as animations, there is an option in the result navigator to start an animation. This animation element can also be found for several list boxes in the program. In this way, the load cases and load combinations as well as the list boxes in the table can be displayed as animations."
Where can I change the license?,"With the modern online licensing system, the licenses for RFEM, RSTAB and all other programs of the Dlubal structural analysis software can be distributed all over the world.

The full versions are marked with a green dot, the test versions with a blue dot and the demo versions with a red dot. In the license manager you can also see which license is used by which user (light green dot) or which license is available for use and can be selected (dark green dot). The existing licenses can also be viewed and the corresponding products downloaded via the license configuration details in the Dlubal account."
How do the different node mesh refinement options differ?,"In general, the generation of the FE mesh can be influenced with a nodal mesh refinement, so that an adapted discretization can be achieved in the refinement area around a node. Two mesh refinement types are available for the geometric shape of the refinement area: * Circular * Rectangular With a circular type, the size of the circular refinement area must be specified using a radius, and both the inner and outer desired length must be defined. The outer FE length usually corresponds to the global mesh size. In the case of a rectangular type, the ""side length"" of the cube-shaped compression area and the ""inner target FE length"" are specified. For circular densifications, the ""FE length arrangement"" can be used to control how the mesh size of the FE mesh expands from the inside to the outside. A distinction is made between the following options: * '''Radial''': The compression area expands evenly from the inside outwards in the form of concentric circles. * '''Incremental''': Incremental compression works on the same principle as radial compression. The difference, however, is that the refinement does not take place in the form of concentric circles, but in sections in areas with the same mesh size. As many square elements as possible are used. * '''Combined''': The gradient here is a combination of radial and step adjustment. The refinement basically behaves like a stepwise refinement. However, if there is a circular or arcuate line that lies at the center of the refinement, a radial refinement is applied."
How does the geo-zone tool determine the earthquake data according to DIN EN 1998-1?,"The raw data comes from DIN EN 1998-1/NA:2021-07 including additional digital content. The GPS coordinates and the response acceleration SaP,R in the plateau area of the response spectrum are available in the form of an Excel spreadsheet. It contains the GPS coordinates for latitude and longitude in decimal degrees with an accuracy of 0.1°. The geo zone tool also works with a grid size of 0.1°x0.1°. The values from the additional digital content are set as the center of each cell. The result of the search query is then taken from the corresponding cell. Intermediate values are not interpolated or extrapolated. It can therefore happen that the color range does not match the result from the cell, since the curves do not follow the grid but are on their own layer. This layer therefore has no influence on the results and only serves to provide a better overview. Example: Location: Ludolf Camphausen Street in Cologne As can be seen in the picture, the location is in the cell with a center point at 6.9° east longitude and 50.9° north latitude. Thus, the searched location receives a response acceleration of 1.7144 m/s², since this is not interpolated."
Why can't I define a rotation when defining layers?,"If no angle can be defined in the 'Rotation' column, an isotropic material model was selected for the material, in which the stiffnesses are identical in all directions anyway and it is not necessary to define an angle. If you use materials with anisotropic behavior (e.g. wood), you must ensure that the material model 'Orthotropic | Linear Elastic (Surfaces)' is selected. Note: The material model 'Orthotropic | '''wood''' | 'Linear elastic (surfaces)' cannot yet be used in combination with the 'Layers' thickness type. After switching to the orthotropic material model, the individual layers can be rotated accordingly."
How can I effectively define line hinges on multiple surfaces?,"If line hinges are to be defined on several boundary lines of surfaces at the same time, the following procedure is recommended: # Create a new line hinge in the data navigator under 'Types for lines' or in the menu 'Insert → Types for lines → Line hinges → Dialog' # Degrees of freedom as desired define # Use the 'Pick function' to select the desired surface and then the desired lines * Do not confirm the function with 'OK', but select additional surfaces and lines with the '+' sign # Only after all line joints have been assigned do the function with ' OK' confirm"
Can the printout report also be opened in another PDF reader?,"To open the printout report with a PDF reader other than Adobe Reader, the desired reader must be set as the default. However, it must be noted that the selected PDF reader supports 3D content so that any 3D graphics that may be present are displayed correctly. To change the default PDF reader, the following workflow can be followed: # Open System Preferences. # Go to ""Apps"", then ""Default apps"" and ""Select default apps by file type"". # Now you can scroll to the file extension "".pdf"" in the alphabetically sorted list and then change the default PDF reader. The printout report is then exported to the desired PDF reader."
What effects does the accuracy setting have on the model?,"In order to eliminate discrepancies in the model caused by data imports from CAD programs or by modeling, RFEM 6 offers the option of defining model tolerances for nodes, lines, surfaces and directions in the input data. In this sense, it is determined from which tolerance the nodes, lines, areas and distances are to be evaluated and summarized as identical. These model tolerances are taken into account in the program on the one hand when individual model parameters are modified using the ""Move/Copy"" function and on the other hand when the ""Drag&Drop"" function is used. However, if the position of the model parameters is defined via the table, the specified tolerances can be fallen below as desired. (Note: In the video, the model tolerance was set somewhat coarser so that the effects of this setting become clearer. Normally, a model tolerance of 0.0005 m is preset by the program.) In RFEM 5, such discrepancies in the model could be automatically corrected using the ""Regenerate model"" function "" be eliminated."
"If I use the search function of the cross-section database, all sorts of similar series of cross-sections are displayed. How can I restrict the search results to the exact cross-section designation?","If you enter a cross-section designation in the name field of the ""New cross-section"" dialog, all cross-section series that contain the search term are suggested. For example, when entering HEA, cross-sections from the HEAA or HEAT series are also suggested. If you want to ensure that the search returns only exact hits, enter quotation marks at the beginning of your search term. The search term for a HEA profile is then: ""HEA"
How can I limit the display of the value scale in RFEM 6 and RSTAB 9 to positive values?,"To set the value scale to a defined range (eg only positive values), double-click in the color scale of the control panel. In the following dialog, change the reference from ""Max/Min"" to ""Limits"" and set the limit values manually (e.g. Min = 0.0). In order to completely hide the excluded value ranges in the graphic, move the slider to the right of the value scale up one level at the minimum (see Illus. 01)."
"I use the Auto Connect Lines/Bars feature when modeling. However, RFEM 6 always creates a connection node of the ""on member"" type. How do I have to proceed in order to split the bars automatically?","In RFEM 6 and RSTAB 9, the program creates a node of the ""on member/on line"" type on the existing line or member by default. However, if you would like to split the existing line or bar automatically, you have the option of changing this in the program options. To do this, go to the ""Options"" > ""Program Options..."" menu. In the following dialog, the Connect ""By internal nodes"" option can be deactivated."
"How can I enable or disable the ""drag and drop"" function?","Moving and copying objects directly in the viewport can be a useful way to work more effectively. However, if you want to deactivate this function, you can do this via the context menu. To do this, click the right mouse button in the view window and find the entry ""Disable drag and drop"" in the list."
How can temporary bearings be defined in RFEM6 for the form-finding process?,"The process for creating temporary storage has changed from RFEM5 to RFEM6. IRFEM5 these were still created via the storage function. in RFEM6 there are two different options. The first possibility is the definition of structural modifications, it is easier with the add-on analysis of construction stages RF-FORMFINDING (more in) by considering the construction process. A more detailed explanation of the definition of temporary storage was given in the online manual. A detailed description of the entire form-finding process can also be found here. A free webinar can also be viewed."
How do I create an imperfection based on a eigenmode in RFEM 6?,"To create an imperfection based on a mode shape, the is required. With this, mode shapes can be determined for a load case or a load combination based on its normal force state. The resulting mode shape can be selected and scaled after creating an imperfection case. The procedure can be seen in the video."
Is the Revit AddIn automatically installed in RFEM6?,"No, the AddIn is not installed automatically. This means that the user must have Revit and RFEM 6 installed on the computer. However, Revit should be closed. You then have to navigate to the following folder: * C:\Program Files\Dlubal\RFEM 6.02\tools\RevitAddIn This contains the ""setup.exe"" file. This can now be executed simply by double-clicking. The Revit AddIn Installer will then open. After completion, the AddIn is installed and the corresponding function is available. It should also be ensured that the server has been started in RFEM. This setting can be found in the RFEM menu ""Options"" under ""Program options"".

How can a smoothing area / a smoothing line be inserted in the result curve of RFEM 6?,"Smoothing areas can be created in the result curves dialog in order to prepare the results for engineers. This function is accessible via the ""Edit smoothing areas of the result curves"" button. In the table on the left, the smoothing areas are to be defined, whereby the entries for start, end and length are dependent on one another. Each area can be activated separately. The ""Use for Results"" section controls which deformations, internal forces, stresses, or strains to smooth. The smoothing can be constant or linear for all smoothing areas. Furthermore, a smoothing line can be displayed over the entire result curve using the button of the same name. The integral of the smoothing range is output if the ""Smoothing with interpretations"" check box is activated in the result curve settings."
Where does the information about the port of Hamburg come from? How far do the boundaries of the Port of Hamburg extend?,"The information on the source from which we obtained the data is always located directly below the map section.

How do you delete only the connection to a project folder in the Dlubal Center?,"If the option to delete a project folder is selected in the Dlubal Center, a dialog window with three options opens. While the ""Yes"" option deletes both the project and the corresponding project folder, the ""No"" option deletes the project, leaving the project folder intact. If the ""Cancel"" option is selected, the dialog window closes without deleting the project or project folder."
"Why does the ""Member loads from distributed load"" load assistant show unnecessary point loads?","If member loads are generated from a surface load, extremely small point loads can result, depending on the nature of the surfaces. If these are then too small to be displayed with the number of decimal places in the output, the load is rounded to the value 0. There is a ""Smooth point load"" check box in the load assistant. If this is activated, such concentrated loads are converted into variable loads. "
Why does the eHORA map of Austria show different snow loads than the geo-zone tool?,"The differences between our snow load map and the HORA web application follow from the range of data used. Our application strictly refers to the valid standard ÖNORM B 1991-1-3:2022-05 with an interval of 0.5 kN/m². The HORA map, on the other hand, uses an interval of 0.1 kN/m². The Dlubal geo-zone tool thus outputs the more conservative, strictly standard-compliant values. The difference for the same coordinates at an example location in Austria is shown in the pictures. Above is the eHORA map, below is our geo-zone tool."
How can I create an ASCE 7-22 response spectrum?,"The ASCE 7-22 standard offers several types of rating spectra. In this FAQ we would like to focus on the following two design spectra: * Multi-period design spectrum (11.4.5.1) * Two-period design spectrum (11.4.5.2) The two-period spectrum is stored in the program as usual. However, based on the available data from the standard, only the horizontal design spectrum/MCER spectrum as well as the force-related and displacement-related modification can be offered. Discrete numerical values are specified for the multi-period design spectrum. ASCE 7-22 states that these values can be queried on the USGS Seismic Design Geodatabase page. In the current development status, you have the option of using a user-defined response spectrum with a g-factor (depending on the [[https://www.dlubal.com/de/downloads-und-infos/dokumente/online-handbuecher/rfem-6 /000369 mass conversion constant]]) to use the data from eg the ASCE 7 Hazard Tool [1]. Please proceed as follows: # Download the data from the response spectrum .csv file from the relevant portal # Convert the .csv file into 2 columns (if necessary, pay attention to ./ , here) # Export a Template from RFEM 6 to know the formatting for the import # Copy the data from the .csv file into the corresponding rows of the template (period and accelerations are sufficient, leave frequencies empty) # Import the Excel data to RFEM 6 # Check that all data has been imported"
"I have display problems in RFEM 6, RSTAB 9 and RSECTION 1 or the program crashes immediately after starting the program. What options do I have to improve this?","Basically, we recommend that you keep the graphics card driver up to date. This can solve many display problems. The new program generation requires OpenGL 4.2. If this is not possible due to your graphics card or the virtualization environment, the programs RFEM 6, RSTAB 9 and RSECTION 1 can alternatively be operated with the MESA Software Renderer from version number X.02.0022. MESA is a free graphics library to implement OpenGL functionality. === To switch to the MESA Software Renderer, please proceed as follows: === 1. Depending on the program concerned, open the folder C:\Program Files\Dlubal\RFEM 6.02\bin C:\Program Files\Dlubal\ RSTAB 9.02\bin C:\Program Files\Dlubal\RSECTION 1.02\bin 2. Run the Windows command script ""Enable Software Renderer.cmd"". This must be done with admin rights. ===Rendering Quality=== There are three rendering options available: Low, Medium, High. Medium is used by default. If you want to take screenshots for marketing purposes or to create presentation material, we recommend the highest quality setting. ==Important note== The ""*.cmd"" files change the settings of the Windows environment for the current user. Problems with other programs can occur if the MESA Library has already been installed and used for other software on the computer. If the workflow shown does not bring any improvement, it is possible that the activation of the renderer failed due to a lack of user rights. In this case, please check whether the ""opengl32.dll"" file is present in the above folder. If not, please copy them from the ""MESA"" subfolder to the ""bin"" folder. === Proceed in the same way to deactivate the MESA software renderer: === 1. Depending on the program concerned, open the folder C:\Program Files\Dlubal\RFEM 6.02\bin C:\Program Files\Dlubal\RSTAB 9.02 \bin C:\Program Files\Dlubal\RSECTION 1.02\bin 2. Run the Windows command script ""Disable Software Renderer.cmd"". This must also be done with admin rights."

"On stairs with a complicated geometry, it is often difficult to verify the weld seams using analytical methods. How can this be done with RFEM?","Where the geometries become complicated, it becomes difficult to use analytical methods for verification. The weld elements in RFEM 6 are of particular help for such applications. RFEM 6 offers designs for different types of welds. The connection type list is used to select how the surfaces to be connected are related to one another. Then the weld type is selected. Finally, the parameters of the weld seam have to be defined. The welds do not interfere with the rigidity of the model. They use the stresses from the surface elements and evaluate them in accordance with the regulations."
How can you take into account different wind profiles for different wind directions?,"With the ""Wind simulations"" load assistant, the program offers support for generating wind simulation load cases. This assistant generates a wind simulation load case with a complete model input for the RWIND calculation lying in the background for a user-defined set of angular positions. In the event that a different wind profile is to be used depending on the angular position, the assistant allows several input sets. To do this, proceed as follows: # Open the Wind simulation load assistant # In the first input set, define the wind profile to be taken into account for a specific angular position segment # Create another input set with another wind profile for the affected angular position segment # Repeat step 3 until all segments are covered"
How can I show or hide the printout report navigator?,You can show or hide the printout report navigator via the menu '''View''' → '''Navigator'''. You can also close the printout report navigator using the button.
How can I carry out a case-related assessment for different load situations?,"The main program RFEM 6 or RSTAB 9 thrives on its uniqueness. The entire input in the program is set up in such a way that a clear result is output for each calculation task. The dimensioning of the objects is organized in a similar way. In the input for each design object, the program manifests the necessary properties with the associated load and, after the analysis, outputs a clear result for this object. If you want to determine your own design results for the complete model for different load levels, the add-on ""Analysis of Construction States (CSA)"" offers a solution. In addition to the basic simulation of the construction process (growth of objects), this add-on also allows the parallel simulation of models with a constant number of objects. In this special case, the base model is internally placed several times next to each other and can thus be transferred to the design with different loads. Proceed as follows to implement it: # Activate the ""Analysis of construction stages (CSA)"" add-on in the general data # In the Navigator under the ""Construction stages"" branch, define the desired states with the ""Start"" attribute and activate all elements # In the ""Load Cases and Combinations"" menu under the ""Construction States"" tab, assign the respective load for each state # After the calculation, evaluate the design depending on the defined states."

My results for the calculation with warping torsion are implausible. What could be the cause?,"First of all, it would be advantageous to re-examine the boundary conditions for verification. This includes, among other things, the selected load approach, checking the transverse stiffeners and the transitions between the members. It is also useful to check the calculation theory, possibly outside of the second-order theory as a result of large rotations. However, it is also particularly important that a division of the FE mesh is required in RFEM for warping torsion. This is possible by checking in the FE mesh settings and the graphical representation of the member FE mesh."
How can I check how RFEM 6 determines the required reinforcement?,"To check how the program calculates a certain required reinforcement area, you can switch to the table with the required reinforcement and there double-click on a cell with the required result value. The dialog with the 'Design details' then opens, in which the determination of the required reinforcement is documented. In the right area of the dialog you will find all the equations that are used in the program and you can see from which verification the required area reinforcement results."
"Even though all checks for a bar are complied with, I get an ""Uncovered reinforcement"". What can be the reason?","The result can be that all checks for a certain member or set of members are satisfied, but an 'uncovered reinforcement' is still output. The reason for this is that the course of the 'existing reinforcement' for the upper and lower layer is generated from the arrangement of the reinforcing bars within the cross-section. Here, the reinforcing bars above the center of gravity are assigned to the 'upper layer' and the reinforcing bars below the center of gravity are assigned to the 'lower layer'. This means that the course of the 'existing reinforcement' does not take into account the actual course of the zero line within the cross-section and does not check which rebar is actually in the tension zone. However, the actual course of the zero line within the cross-section is checked in the verifications. This means that reinforcing bars that were geometrically assigned to the 'lower reinforcement' (course of the existing reinforcement) can also be assigned to the tensile reinforcement by calculation. The reinforcing bars marked in red have been geometrically assigned to the lower reinforcement. From the stress distribution within the cross-section, however, it can be seen that these are also under tension and are used accordingly for the verification. All members are used for the verification. Therefore, the verifications are all complied with at this point, although the course of the 'uncovered reinforcement' suggests otherwise."
How can I delete all unassigned loads?,Unassigned loads can be deleted via the menu * Edit → Delete → Loads → All unassigned loads.
During the installation I get an error message R6025. What should I do?,"The error ""R6025 - Pure virtual function call"" is related to the MS Visual C++ Libraries. You can use this YouTube video for error analysis: It can also be helpful to unzip the installation file and use the Dlubal RFEM 64-bit.msi file directly for the installation."
Is it also possible to use user-defined materials in RF-/FE-BUCKLING?,"Custom materials can also be used in RF/FE BUMPLING. When you create the material in RFEM/RSTAB, you must ensure that the material has the same properties as the steel materials permitted according to the standard selected in RF-/FE-BUCKLING. To do this, select a material from the standard series in the material library and open the 'Create new material' dialog via the button. Here you can change all the default values. You also have to use the filter 'Metal' for the material category group, 'Steel' for the material category and 'EN' for the standard group for a design according to standard EN 1993-1 Set -5 or 'DIN' for the standard group for a design according to DIN 18800. The material can also be created in the add-on module or individual program RF-/FE-BUCKLING. The filter material category group, material category and standard group are preset in the 'Transfer material from library' dialog according to the selected standard. When creating a user-defined material, these filters should be left as they are."
Can I have the dimensioning formulas in the printout report displayed a little larger?,"Yes, that is possible. To do this, right-click on the formula sheet after the formula has been exported to the printout report. In the context menu that then opens, select ""Edit"" and you get to the window for the source code. There you can now increase the number of pixels in the line "".printFontSize {font-size: 8px;}""."
How can I clearly print the internal forces for a cross-section in the printout report?,"That's what the Result Table Manager is for. Here you can first activate the desired tables. The ""Result filter from the current table set"" function can then be activated in the printout report manager under the report element ""Members - internal forces by cross-section"" and the options. With this, the respective table view of the main program is also set for the printout report."
"I would like to apply moving loads to members in my model, but I can't find the RF-MOVE add-on module. What can I do?","An add-on for creating moving loads is currently not available in RFEM 6 and RSTAB 9. However, it is possible to create moving loads on members using the Script Manager. To do this, use the attached scripts of this FAQ. Copy this into the ""user_scripts"" folder of the respective working directory of RFEM or RSTAB. In the script manager you will find the script ""Move"" under ""User scripts"". Double-click to run it. In the following dialog, enter the amount of the nodal load in the Z direction, the number of load steps and the number of the member to be loaded. Click on ""Run"" and the corresponding load cases will be generated automatically."
"Can we transfer ""foundation loads"" (support loads from e.g. hall supports) to another RFEM model and recombine them as loads for the floor slab?","When creating static calculations, the derivation of the forces from the roof to the foundations, in addition to the dimensioning of the cross sections themselves, is one of the central tasks of the calculation. In a 3D building model, this flow of forces is automatically guaranteed by the coherent modeling of ceilings, columns, walls, foundations, etc. Sometimes, however, one deliberately decides against modeling on the overall model, which then means that the load transfer has to be carried out manually. The function ""Apply support reaction as load..."", as it is in RFEM 5, is currently still in the development phase for RFEM 6 and will be submitted in an improved form. However, there is already a workaround with which you can also transfer the support reactions in RFEM 6 as a load to another model. To do this, you export the desired line support forces to EXCEL and read them back into another model file as a line load."
How can I save my preferred display properties settings as a template?,"You have the option of saving the current settings of the display properties as a template directly in the ""Display properties"" dialog via the icon in the footer."
RSTAB and RFEM crash immediately when the program is started. I work with a 3D mouse. What is the reason?,"The problem is caused by a conflict between RFEM or RSTAB and the 3Dconnexion mouse driver. To fix the problem, you can right-click on the driver via the icons in the Windows taskbar and briefly activate and deactivate the creation of the log file in the context menu. Afterwards, RSTAB 8 and RFEM 5 should start again as usual. Alternatively, you can also replace the existing driver with an older driver (version 10.8.3, download link attached). You can then use your Dlubal software as usual again."
The output of the extreme values is not displayed. Where can I activate the MAX/MIN info?,"If you no longer see the MAX/MIN information, please check that you have enabled this in the Show navigator."
need many eigenmodes to get a sum of 90% effective modal mass. Can I limit the number of eigenmodes for generating the equivalent loads?,"Yes, that is possible. Eigenmodes that only have a small proportion of the effective modal mass can be ignored. You have the option of specifying this manually or using a filter in the program. The selection of eigenmodes also has a direct effect on performance. The lower the number of mode shapes, the lower the number of load cases to be generated."
"I have a license for the Geotechnical Analysis add-on and it shows as available. However, it cannot be activated. What could be the reason?","Please note that in the first tab ""Basic"" of the basic data, both the model type ""3D"" and ""Solid"" must be activated as main objects to be activated. Only when these settings are made, can the add-on be used and only then can it be activated."
How do I apply for a university license?,"The university licenses for RFEM 6 and RSTAB 9 are controlled via a collective user. The license can only be used on computers that log in to the Dlubal license server via the public / static IP address of the university. We therefore need the following information from you: # E-mail address of the collective user (functional e-mail address) # Number of licenses # Public / static IP address of the university gateway. An IP address range can also be named here. After the license has been successfully created, the university license can be used with the login data of the collective user (we will provide you with the password)."
"I downloaded RFEM 6 but I can't find the option ""Generate model - Members"" like we have in RFEM 5. Can you tell me where this option is?","We no longer offer such model generators in RFEM6. Now you can create some predefined structures via the ""Dlubal Center Blocks"". These structures are defined by parameters and can be easily modified at will."
How can I display the result value for VEd in the results of the static analysis?,"The value ""VEd"" from the concrete design does not exist in the static analysis. However, the result ""vmax,b"" from the main internal forces of the area can be displayed. The concrete design uses exactly this ""vmax,b"" as ""VEd"". "
"Is it possible to calculate a selection of load cases, load combinations and result combinations? Especially with large models, you don't always want to have all load cases calculated.","Yes, that is possible. To do this, click on ""Calculate"" in the menu bar and on ""To calculate..."" in the menu selection. The ""To be calculated"" dialog then opens, in which the desired load cases/combinations and add-ons to be calculated can be selected. The calculation starts with a click on ""OK""."
How do I set a joint for a warp?,"Hinges for warping are standard at each bar end. Therefore, the splitting of rods leads to a hinge of the warp. If you don't want a warping hinge, but want a continuous warping, you have to define a set of members. The warping is automatically transferred there when the ""Warping torsion"" add-on is activated. If this is not desired for the set of members, the ""Discontinuous warping torsion"" option should be activated."
The terrain surface of my building ground to be analyzed is uneven. How can I edit the geometry of my soil massif for its modelling?,"The geometry of the soil bodies of a soil massif can be edited manually if the type ""Soil solids set"" is set for the massif in the input dialog. ==== Step 1 (optional) - Soil massif from soil samples ==== The massif can first be generated from soil samples in order to show the advantage of the generated soil volume bodies with the soil materials and layer boundaries that result from the data of the subsoil investigations contained in the soil samples. to use. This can be done in a first step. ==== Step 2 - Setting the type of soil volume set ==== In a second step, the soil massif type can be changed from (1) Generated from soil samples to (2) Soil volume set. After confirming this step, the calculated coordinates of the ground mass appear. Note: It should be noted that this step cancels the ""generated"" status, which means, among other things, that the connection to the soil samples is broken in order to enable editing. ==== Step 3 - Editing the Geometry of the Ground Solids ==== The ground solids can now be edited and the desired geometry of the terrain surface can be created with all the tools available and known in RFEM 6."
What value can I use for cohesion to avoid singularities?,"When using numerical methods such as FEM in geotechnics, it can be helpful if the cohesion is set to be non-zero. For this purpose, the definition of a small mathematical cohesion between 0.5 and 1.0 kN/m² can also be useful for non-cohesive soils."
Is there an easy way to generate a tangent to a circle in RFEM 6?,"The object snap can be edited under the Auxiliary Objects category. The ""Tangent"" option can be activated in the object snap settings. If you then want to construct a straight line on a circle, the snap point on the circle for a tangent is now also displayed."
How can I define a warping spring or warping leg tension?,"After the warping torsion has been activated in the basic data, warping springs and warping leg stresses can be defined. To do this, activate transverse stiffeners in the ""Edit member"" dialog window, ""Basic"" tab. In the ""Transverse stiffeners"" tab, several transverse stiffeners can be created and the necessary parameters can be defined using the ""New transverse stiffener"" button . With the ""end plate"" stiffener type, the resulting warping spring is automatically determined depending on the material and dimensions. In addition to other variants, a rigid warping leg stress or user-defined warping spring stiffness can also be defined under the ""warping spring"" stiffener type. Alternatively, transverse stiffeners can also be created via the data navigator or the menu bar ""Insert"", ""Types for members"", ""Stiffeners"". In this case, they are to be assigned to the corresponding members using the pick function at the top right of the ""New member transverse stiffener"" dialog box."
At which point on the cross-section are supports and loads assumed for the calculation with warping torsion?,"Both bearing forces and loads are assumed when calculating with warping torsion in the center of gravity. Accordingly, an asymmetrical profile would automatically have torsion."
"I want to create a rotationally symmetrical surface in RFEM 6. However, the surface of revolution is not created. Why is that?","In the case of surfaces of revolution in RFEM 6, it must always be ensured that the boundary line and the axis of revolution do not cross. Otherwise the surface of revolution is corrupt and cannot be created. One way to create the surface is to split the boundary line at the intersection with the axis of rotation. In the example shown, the curved line must be divided once in the middle. After dividing the boundary line and eliminating the input error, RFEM automatically creates the entered surface of revolution."
"If we have RFEM 6 / RSTAB 9 / RSECTION 1 installed, does the application communicate or coexist with your systems/data? Do you store the data or do we receive data from you?","Yes, the new generation of programs (RFEM 6, RSTAB 9, RSECTION 1) communicates with our web server (extranet) to which you as the user have constant online access. We use the data to optimize our software and you to manage your data and licenses. You will also find the latest news and information about newly implemented features and fixed bugs. You can also enter the desired features there. We do not store any program data (e.g. RFEM files) from the customer."
Does RWIND 2 also work on a MAC?,"On the hardware side, there shouldn't be any issues as long as it's an Intel or ARM based MAC. However, the problem is the operating system. Unfortunately, MacOS is not yet supported. You must have Windows installed on the MAC with either dual boot, bootcamp or virtualization eg Parallels Desktop. However, it should be noted that there are license restrictions when using virtual machines and the software key cannot be used. The conclusion: # RWIND runs on MAC parallels in demo mode; no calculation and no data storage possible. # In order to run the full version of RWIND on MAC, the hardware key is required; the user must have a valid license."
How can installations for RFEM 6 and RSTAB 9 be distributed over the network?,"The installation packages can be distributed via an MSI file (Windows Installer Package). To do this, it is first necessary to extract the MSI file from the installation package. To do this, start the setup.exe with the parameter ""/E"" (RFEM_6.02.0007.exe /E). The RFEM installation file was copied to the C:\Temp drive. After decompression you will find a new folder named ""ProgramVersionNumber_Architecture"" in the same path. A folder named ""Dlubal_RFEM_6.02.0007"" was created. The installation can then be started from this folder with the command ""msiexec -i >paketname>.msi"". If the language is also to be in German, the command is as follows: msiexec /i Dlubal_RFEM_64bit.msi TRANSFORMS=:1031.mst /quiet If the command -q (=-quiet) is used, the installation runs without a user interface. '''Note that the command prompt is started using the right mouse button and the context menu option ""Run as administrator"". In some cases it may happen that the EXE has to be set to Unblock in the security settings of the file after unpacking. The file can then also be unpacked.''' The German version is installed with the ""TRANSFORMS=1031.mst"" parameter. If the English version is to be installed, then this parameter must be omitted. Detailed information about all commands and language IDs can be found below: * 1031 - German * 1033 - English (United States) * 1036 - French * 1034 - Spanish * 2070 - Portuguese * 1040 - Italian * 1043 - Dutch * 1029 - Czech * 1045 - Polish * 1049 - Russian * 2052 - Chinese (Simplified)"
How can I turn off the 7th degree of freedom only for certain members or cross-sections?,"The warping stiffness can be deactivated for each cross-section within the ""Edit cross-section"" dialog box."
How can I display the cross-sectional warping?,"The warping of a cross-section can be shown in the ""full mode"" plot. To do this, it makes sense to increase the display factor for warping torsion in the control panel. In addition, the value of the local deformation ω [1/m] can be selected in the result navigator."
"In RFEM 6, can I output a graphic showing the course of the required reinforcement in DIN A0 format?","Yes, this is possible in RFEM 6. First check whether there is a printer with the DIN A0 format in the Windows control panel. If this is the case, this printer is available in the printer settings in RFEM 6. You can find an example with a printout report in DIN A0 format via the link in the downloads."
I get an error message when trying to edit a script. What can I do?," If you get an error, it may be because Windows is trying to open the JavaScript file with the wrong editor/program. Please check which application is used to open the JavaScript file in your Windows settings and adjust it accordingly. In our example we choose Notepad++. Once this is customized you can edit the script."
How can you quickly create a dished end with RFEM 6?,"In RFEM 6 it is possible to access numerous model templates via the ""Dlubal Center - Blocks"". In the ""Silos and storage tanks"" block category, among other things, dished ends can also be created. After a block has been selected, the block can be quickly imported into the existing RFEM model by entering the structural data."
How can blocks be created and opened in RFEM 6 / RSTAB 9?,"A block is initially saved as in RFEM 5 / RSTAB 8, it is read in via the Dlubal Center: 1) Select the objects to be saved 2) ""File"" menu, ""Save as block"", important here: enter the model category. 3) In the target file, open the Dlubal Center via the ""File"" menu or the toolbar and open the block in the corresponding model category."
Why can't I create surfaces in my RFEM model?,"The areas under ""Main objects to be activated"" are probably deactivated within the basic model data."
"Instability is always displayed when using multiple scissor joints. However, I cannot find the cause."," When using scissor joints, it should always be ensured that the same pair of joints is always used for the continuous bar. If different pairs face each other on the continuous rod, instability occurs."
Does the design method selected in RSECTION affect the design of the cross-section in RFEM/RSTAB?,"No, regardless of whether the design method ""Finite Element Analysis"" or ""Analytical Design Method"" was selected in RSECTION - for the design in RFEM/RSTAB, only the method on which the corresponding design tool (add-on) is used is relevant. based."
Why are new LCs generated in RF-/FOUNDATION Pro during the calculation?,"If the design of sliding and/or method 2* for the bearing failure design has been activated in RF-/FOUNDATION Pro, the program requires characteristic load eccentricities for these designs according to EN 1997-1-1. However, the user has to select a gamma-fold ULS load (LK or EK) for the verification. The RF-/FOUNDATION Pro add-on module then automatically generates characteristic load cases from these gamma-fold load cases (LK or EK) and saves them in the background in the module. Therefore, during the calculation of the module case, you are shown the convergence course of the calculation of LK's, which do not exist in the model at all."
"I would like to model a frame bar with a haunch (with a cropped cross-section). For this I created a member with the cross-section distribution ""Haven at the beginning of the member"". However, the resulting cross-section is displayed incorrectly in the rendering. Where is the error?","If there are different cross-section types at the start and end of a haunch member that do not have the same number of stress points, RSTAB/RFEM draws the first half with one cross-section and the second half with the other cross-section. In addition, it is necessary that the stress points with the same numbers face each other. Sections defined in RSECTION 1 generally cannot be used to create haunches. This also applies if a member is haunched, for example, at the beginning of the member. The stress points of the cross-sections used must match over the entire length of the bar.  The attempt to generate the cross-section transition to the rest of the member via an additional haunch leads to an incorrect member definition.  Here, however, the cropped cross-section of the haunch runs to the end of the entire bar. If it is absolutely necessary that the rest of the bar has a different cross-section than the haunch at the start of the bar, the bar must be divided. In this way, the haunch can be represented (taking into account the arrangement of the stress points) as a member with a ""Linear"" cross-section and any other cross-section can be selected for the rest of the member. ==Note== The easiest way to model haunches is to use weld profiles or parameterized cross-sections. For example, you could copy the profile with the lower height and then adjust the height and/or width of the second cross section."
"Where can I find the graphical results for punching in the concrete design? Specifically, the course of the shear forces in the critical perimeter or the punching loads.",You can also find the results for punching in the results navigator. The results are divided into the checks 'At nodes' and the reinforcement 'At nodes'. The punching loads and the course of the shear forces in the critical perimeter (smoothed and not smoothed) are intermediate results of the checks and are arranged accordingly in this part of the navigator.
In which format should the longitude and latitude geocoordinates be entered in the online service?,"If the location is given by longitude and latitude, the online service shall use the decimal degrees format. Entering ""degrees, minutes and seconds"" and ""degrees and decimal minutes"" is not accepted. Example: Latitude: 49.435° Longitude: 12.590° Written as decimal degrees (DG) 49.435, 12.590"
I don't get any local support reactions at line supports in RFEM 6. How do I go about getting these?,"If RFEM displays identical support reactions in local and global direction, although the local line axis system is clearly not identical to the global coordinate system, this is most likely due to the line support definition. It is worth taking a look at the ""Edit line support"" dialog. If ""Global XYZ"" is set here for the coordinate system, the support definition is aligned with the global axis system. Consequently, only global support reactions can be determined. If you change the coordinate system to ""Local xyz"", the line support is defined according to the line axis system. This means that local support reactions can also be calculated. The alignment of the line supports is also visualized in the rendering."
How can I insert a DXF file as a background layer in RFEM 6 or RSTAB 9?,"RFEM and RSTAB offer the possibility to import DXF files as background layers. These can then be used as auxiliary objects and thus enable fast and efficient modelling. The easiest way to import a DXF file as a background layer is to use the data navigator. A new background layer is inserted via ""Helper objects"" -> right-click on ""Background layers"" -> ""New background layer..."". In the dialog that then appears, select the DXF file from your own files. It is also possible to move, rotate and scale the background layer in the model area in all three spatial axes. Furthermore, background slides can be set to active or inactive as required."
"What is the difference between the ""Finite element calculation"" and ""Analysis of thin-walled structures"" verification methods?","The difference between the two verification methods ""finite element calculation"" and ""analysis of thin-walled structures"" is the calculation of the cross-section values and the stresses on the gross cross-section. With the finite element calculation, the calculation is based on the FE method. When analyzing thin-walled structures, the calculation is essentially carried out analytically according to the theory for calculating thin-walled cross-sections, whereby it is assumed that the force flow is not transverse to the respective element but rather along the center line. If the user has a cross-section of any polygonally delimited surfaces with or without recesses, the finite element calculation (formerly DICKQ) is a suitable verification method. If, on the other hand, there is an open, closed or coherent profile consisting of mainly thin-walled elements, the analysis of thin-walled structures (formerly SHAPE-THIN) is suitable."
Where can defined types (e.g. design supports or buckling lengths) be hidden?,"Hiding elements and associated types takes place in the navigator 'Display'. Every defined element and every type can be shown or hidden there. Once the personal, desired setting has been found, it can these can be saved as 'Default' or to a file: "
Can I apply a factor to the loads of one or more load cases that increases or decreases all loads in these load cases equally?,"Yes, that is possible. To do this, it is best to create a new ""Static analysis setting"". In addition to the calculation theory and various other settings, a multiplication factor for the loads can also be set here. The configured ""Static analysis settings"" can then be assigned to the respective load cases ."
"If I display the loads from the load assistant separately in my model, they disappear. What am I doing wrong?","The load assistant mentioned here distributes distributed loads on members. By default, these are displayed as area loads. The program offers the option of displaying the generated loads separately. This can be done, for example, using the ""Display navigator"". However, it is important to ensure that the display for both ""Load assistant -> Member load from area load "" and ""Object loads -> Member loads"" must be activated. If you still do not see any loads, check please the definition of the generated load. In the settings of the load assistant you can check on which members the generated load is applied. In addition, the generated member loads are displayed in the ""Data Navigator"" and in the ""Member Loads"" table. More information on creating the load assistant is available at Manual. "
How can I adjust the partial safety factors and combination factors in RFEM 6 and RSTAB 9?,"You can change all partial safety factors and combination factors by creating a new, user-defined standard. To do this, open the basic model data, select a basic standard in the ""Standards I"" tab that you would like to use as a guide and click the ""Edit"" button. You will see the following window (non-editable) specifications of the basic standard. Select the ""Create"" button. The action categories are transferred from the selected basic standard to the user-defined standard."
How can I graphically deselect elements in RFEM 6? It seems like I can only select them. But don't deselect.,"If you simply select an element in RFEM 6 by clicking it, it will appear in the selection or selection list. If you want to deselect this object again, you have to press the [Shift] key. Then the '-' symbol appears on the screen and you are in the mode for deselecting already selected objects (e.g. boundary lines).At this point the program behavior has been slightly adjusted compared to RFEM 5 , so you can't accidentally deselect objects."
Where can the reduction of load combinations be activated in RFEM 6? And how does this reduction work?,"The reduction can be activated for each design situation using the option in the combination assistant.By activating this option, the results of the individual load cases are examined. With these results, the load cases are then divided into 'groups' by the program, depending on whether the result (internal force, deformation or support force) is 'maximum' or 'minimum' when viewed in absolute terms.In the small example in the appendix to this FAQ, the following load cases were defined, which lead to the following span moments My:LC1 - self-weight - permanent load: span moment My = 4.0 kNmLF2 - payload (+) - variable load: field moment My = 6.0 kNm LF3 - payload (-) - variable load: field moment My = -2.0 kNmLF4 - snow (+) - variable load: field moment My = 5.0 kNmLF5 - Snow (-) - variable load: field moment My = -2.50 kNm LF6 - Temp (+) - temperature load: field moment My = 1.0 kNmLF7 - Temp (+) - temperature load: field moment M y = 1.50 kNmIf you were to carry out the load combinations for the ultimate limit state without the reduction, the program according to EN 1990 would initially generate 13 action combinations, which would result in 105 load combinations.If the reduction of the load combinations is activated, the program first analyzes the results of the individual load cases and then classifies them into the 'groups' mentioned at the beginning. We get a 'group' with positive internal forces (LF1, LF2, LF4, LF6 and LF7) and a 'group' with negative internal forces (LF3 and LF5).'Positive group': LF1 , LF2, LF4, LF6 and LF7'Negative group': LF3 and LF5 With active reduction of the load combinations, the LCs are now from these 'groups ' is generated, whereby the load case from the action category 'Permanent' (LC1) is also taken into account for the group with a negative sign. This also means that the action combination EW1 previously shown is no longer taken into account because it is clear from the 'groups' that the self-weight or the permanent loads alone cannot lead to either a maximum or a minimum internal force. However, the other action combinations remain valid even with active reduction. However, the load combinations are now formed from these groups, so that there are only five load combinations.In the current development status of RFEM 6 (as of February 2022), the 'groups' mentioned above are generated automatically within the program by evaluating the load case results of all members or surfaces for the internal forces, deformations and support reactions. However, at a later date there will also be the possibility of being able to control the criteria for the reduction of the load combinations in a user-defined manner with regard to a specific object or a specific result."
I have activated steel design in my model and defined design types for the members. Why can't I design the superior set of members?,"If you want to design a set of members in RFEM 6 or RSTAB 9, the design must be activated in the definition of the set of members. If this is not the case, the set of members is declared invalid in the design and is not taken into account. Double click on the set of members to edit it . By activating the design properties, they can be edited in the additional tabs. Click OK to exit the dialog and the set of members is available for design. Please note that when you activate the design properties of a set of members, the subordinate single members can no longer be activated for the design. "
How can you modify the stiffness of certain members in RFEM 6 and RSTAB 9 using a factor?,"Stiffnesses of members can be modified using member stiffness modification and structure modification. In the data navigator you will find the member stiffness modifications under ""Types for members"". If necessary, a list of various modifications can be created in the corresponding dialog window. Part stiffness and weight can be modified under ""Modification type"". In the next step, you can also use the data navigator under ""Special Objects"" to create a structure modification. Within this, activate the ""Members"" option in the ""Basic"" tab so that the ""Members"" tab becomes active. The appropriate member stiffness modification including the respective members is then to be selected in the ""Members"" tab. Of course, a new member stiffness modification can also be created here directly via the dropdown menu. In the last step, the desired structure modification is to be activated in the ""Load cases and combinations"" dialog window in the corresponding load case or the corresponding load combination. Again, a new structure modification can be created directly from here. "
Is it possible to calculate the stresses of welds between surfaces with RFEM 6?,"Yes, that is possible. If a weld seam is defined on a line in the surface model, the stresses of the line weld seam can be calculated with the add-on ""stress-strain calculation"". The following connection types are available available: Butt kickCorner kickOverlap kickT-joint Based on the selected connection type, the following designs of the weld seam can be selected: Square seamDouble square seamDHV seamV seamDV seamU seamDU seamJ seamDJ seam"
"Immediately after starting the program, I get an error message saying ""Assertion failed!"". What can I do to fix the problem?","If you click 'Ignore All' after the message appears, the Crash Report should open automatically. Alternatively, you can try the CrashReporter manually to start. The executable file can be found in the program directory. For RFEM 6.01, the path looks like this: C:\Program Files\Dlubal\RFEM 6.01\bin\CrashReporter.exe So you can at least send us your system information. We will then try to find and fix the cause of the problem as quickly as possible. "
"Where can you activate the ""Favorable permanent actions"" option in RFEM 6 and RSTAB 9 so that the self-weight in the ultimate limit state is also combined with 1.0?","You will find the ""Favorable permanent actions"" option within the respective combination assistant under Options II. The combination assistant is available either in the ""Load cases and combinations"" dialog window → ""Design situations"" tab → ""Options"" or via the data navigator → ""Load cases and Combinations"" → ""Combination assistant"". If you activate the favorable permanent actions, load combinations with 1.0 times the self-weight are then also created. "
How can torsion be neglected in steel and timber design?,Torsional moments are neglected via the limit values for special cases within the respective design configuration for the load-bearing capacity. 
"Can I use RF-CONCRETE Surfaces to define a user-defined additional reinforcement only in certain partial areas of a surface, while the rest continues to be determined automatically?","It makes sense to divide the area accordingly and create a new reinforcement set in window 1.4 ""Reinforcement"". Please note that a new reinforcement set can only be created if areas are available for it and have not already been assigned to another reinforcement set. "
Why can't I select a user-defined additional reinforcement in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces for the serviceability limit state analysis?,"Please make sure that you have deactivated the ""Find most economical reinforcement for crack width check"" option within the settings for the check method under General data, ""Serviceability limit"" tab. It is only possible to define a user-defined additional reinforcement without this option. "
My model in RFEM 6/ RSTAB 9 is unstable. How can I correct this?,"There can be many reasons for unstable systems. The best way to investigate the reason for this message is to use the Structural Stability add-on. With this add-on is it is possible to calculate your structure without loading and thus to carry out a proof of instability through the eigenform.You can thus display the unstable form of your structure.As can be seen in our example , the upper steel girders give way to the side. A closer look at our modeling reveals that we unconsciously created an articulated chain of fixed-articulated type couplings have generated. If we delete this articulated chain, we can calculate our load case."
"Do you have to rewrite your own tools, such as for model input, that were created with RF-COM for use in RFEM 6?","Yes, these have to be rewritten because the COM interface is based on other command libraries. So that RFEM can be addressed via web services, we offer libraries for various programming languages. With these, programs can then be written in the respective language. Currently, the libraries are only available for Python and C#."
Is the import from Microsoft Excel still available in RFEM 6 and RSTAB 9?,"Yes, this is still possible. To do this, a plug-in must be installed in Microsoft Excel, which you will find in the Dlubal installation folder under Tools, see the following path (depending on the version number):C:\Program Files\Dlubal\RFEM 6.01 \tools\ExcelAddInC:\Program Files\Dlubal\RFEM 6.02\tools\ExcelAddInAfter the installation you will find the import and export function in MS Excel under the ""Dlubal"" tab. You should also make sure that the server has been started in RFEM. This setting can be found in the RFEM menu ""Options"" under ""Program options""."
Is the German National Annex 2021-07 to Eurocode 8 available in RFEM 5/ RSTAB 8?,"No. The national annex DIN EN 1998-1/NA:2011-01 is available in RFEM 5 and RSTAB 8. You can see this in the settings for the earthquake zone, or read about it in the performance characteristics of the additional module. You will find the national appendix DIN EN 1998 -1/NA:2021-07 in RFEM 6 or RSTAB 9 and can export it there as required as described in FAQ 005181 and import it into RFEM 5/ RSTAB 8. "
Is there a free viewer to open files from RFEM 6 or RSTAB 9?,"There is no longer a special viewer mode in the current program generation, as there was in RSTAB 8 and RFEM 5. However, you can activate the free demo version after successfully logging into the program. With the demo version, the model data with results can be opened and viewed. Changes to the model data are not possible. The printout report can also be viewed with a watermark in demo mode."
How can you create imperfections on surfaces in RFEM 6 based on the governing buckling figur?,"To generate surface imperfections based on the governing buckling figur, you need the ""Structural Stability"" add-on. Activate this within the basic model data in the ""Add-Ons"" tab. Then run for the corresponding load case ( or load combination) performs the structural stability by activating it in the corresponding load case and selecting the appropriate stability analysis setting. After the eigenform has been calculated, define an imperfection case with the imperfection type ""buckled figur"" including the corresponding parameters in the respective tabs ""Basic"", ""Bucked figur"" and ""Assignment"". Now create a new second-order load combination (default setting) and activate the corresponding imperfection there. When calculating this load combination, the corresponding imperfection is taken into account."

"How to create a bar end hinge with ""Diagram"" using the COM interface?","In order to be able to create a non-linear element such as a member end hinge with diagram or projection, the member end hinge must first be created. If RFEM knows the member end release, this can be fetched via the IMemberEndRelease interface. This interface then has the GetData() and SetData() methods. Both methods are able to read and write both the simple member end release data of the MemberEndRelease type and the data of a non-linearity.In the following example, a release is first activated for the x-direction in the member end release and then as Non-linearity in x-direction of the type WorkingDiagramType set. After this data has been transferred to RFEM using a Prepare-Finish-Modification block, the latter creates the non-linearity internally. In order to fill this with data, the existing data is first fetched from the interface of the rod end hinge via GetData().After the data (NonlinearityDiagram) has been filled in, it is transferred again with SetData(): Sub SetNLDiagram() Dim model As RFEM5.modelSet model = GetObject(, ""RFEM5.Model"") On Error GoTo e Dim iApp As RFEM5.ApplicationSet iApp = model.GetApplication iApp.LockLicenseiApp.Show Dim iModelData As RFEM5.iModelDataSet iModelData = model.GetModelData ' modify member end release' set nonlinearity ""Diagram"" for x translationDim iMemHing As RFEM5.IMemberHingeSet iMemHing = iModelData.GetMemberHinge(1, AtNo) Dim memHing As RFEM5.MemberHingememHing = iMemHing.GetData()memHing.TranslationalConstantX = 0memHing.TranslationalNonlinearityX = WorkingDiagramType ' Set new dataiModelData.PrepareModificationiMemHing.SetData memHingiModelData.FinishModification ' create diagramDim tbl1() As DoubleReDim tbl1(1, 1)tbl1(0, 0) = 0 ' uxtbl1(0, 1) = 0 ' Px tbl1(1, 0) = 0.02 ' ux (mm)tbl1(1, 1) = 2000 ' Px (N) Dim nldHing As RFEM5.NonlinearityDiagramnldHing.ForceType = StiffnessDiagramForceType.NoneStiffnessForce nldHing.PositiveZoneType = DiagramAfterLastStepType.TearingDiagramTypenldHing.PositiveZone = tbl1nldHing.Symmetric = True Dim iNldiag As RFEM5.INonlinearityDiagramSet iNldiag = iMemHing.GetNonlinearity(AlongAxisX) ' Set new dataiModelData.PrepareModificationiNldiag.SetData nldHingiModelData.FinishModification e: If Err.Number <> 0 Then MsgBox Err.description, , Err.Source model.GetApplication.UnlockLicense End Sub The procedure is analogous for nodal supports and other non-linearities.

"When I analyze the combinations using the geometric linear method, it seems that the parallel computation works. However, when I change the method to II-order, it seems that the solver calculates the combinations one by one.","There are two different ways of using multiple cores: Inner parallelization The parts of a program process are run simultaneously in running multiple threads. It is recommended to only use physical cores, not logical (virtual) ones. Experiences with scientific and technical calculations have shown that parallelization has an advantage of about three and a half times the speed-up, regardless of the number of cores. Some processes, such as the iterative solver, are not suitable for such parallelization. Outer parallelization Individual computations are executed in individual threads. For example, four solvers can be run in four threads to calculate four different load combinations. RSTAB 9: The outer parallelization is used. RFEM 6: Inner parallelization is used in some parts of the program - local stiffness matrix assembly, direct solver...The program part called ""FemBase "" is massively parallelized: it calculates the result combinations and returns all the results to the graphs, tables, and respective sections. It can read the result of three load cases in three threads and, for example, calculate the result combination in the fourth thread. The outer parallelization is carried out by the Solver Manager, which is specially designed for RFEM6 was developed. Calculations for steel design, timber design, aluminum design and concrete design should also be done in parallel. All load cases that are calculated linearly (physical linearity) have the same stiffness matrix.Non-linearly calculated load cases and load combinations usually have different stiffness matrices that are compiled separately. (But even in these cases we try to group the cases with the same stiffness matrix, which is only assembled once for a given group.)"
Are the plugins for Rhino and Grasshopper automatically installed in RFEM6?,"No, the plugins are not installed automatically. This means that the user must have installed Rhino 7 or Grasshopper and RFEM 6 on the computer. However, Rhino or Grasshopper should be closed. You must then navigate to the following folder: C:\Program Files\Dlubal\RFEM 6.01\tools\RhinoPlugin The file ""DlubalRfem6Plugin.rhi"" is located there. This must now simply be executed with a double click. The Rhino package installer will then open. After completion, the plugin is installed and you will find the respective icons for controlling the interfaces in Rhino 7 and Grasshopper. You should also make sure that the server has been started in RFEM. This setting can be found in the RFEM menu ""Options"" under ""Program options""."
"Unfortunately, the test period of my test version of RFEM 6 / RSTAB 9 has already expired. How can I continue testing new Dlubal products?","In the case of test phases that have already been successfully completed, we can unfortunately only offer a reduced test phase. If you are interested in a specific add-on, you can contact one at any time Contact our sales representative to enable customization of the trial license(s) of the desired products/add-ons. "
How can contact between two surfaces be realized as quickly as possible?,"In RFEM 5, a contact volume was required to create a contact between two surfaces. In RFEM 6 this can be realized using surface contact:1) Define a surface contact type: Either in the data navigator under ""Types for special objects"" or directly within the surface contact under ""Special objects"" → ""Surface contact"" . 2) Assign the corresponding surfaces and the surface contact type to the surface contact. "
How to assign existing loads to another load case?,"Existing loads are assigned to another load case in the ""Edit nodal load/member load/line load/area load"" dialog box under ""Load case"". "
"Why are free line loads not completely displayed in certain places after I have copied them, for example?","In this case, please pay attention to the correct allocation of the corresponding area. "
How can I optimize cross-sections within the steel design?,"Cross-sections to be designed can be optimized as follows:Select ""Steel design"" and ""Input data"" in the RFEM table window. Then select the ""Optimize"" option in the ""Select another cross-section for the design"" column in the ""Cross-sections"" tab. Now the design can be carried out again for this cross-section. Since the internal forces can change with new cross-sections and therefore new stiffnesses, there is an option to export optimized cross-sections to RFEM/RSTAB via the context menu. The cross-section optimization described only applies to standardized cross-sections. For further optimization we recommend the add-on Optimization & Cost."
Can I also use RWIND 2 with RFEM 5/ RSTAB 8?,"Yes, RWIND 2 Basic can be used with this program generation from version RFEM 5.27.01/ RSTAB 8.27.01. You only have to open the solver version in the wind load settings Convert RWIND 2.If RWIND does not start, start RFEM or RSTAB as administrator and try again."
"What do the two terms ""Factor existing reinforcement"" and ""Optimize existing reinforcement"" mean in the reinforced concrete design.","These are two different methods for calculating the required longitudinal reinforcement. Factor existing reinforcement The entire existing longitudinal reinforcement (compression and tension reinforcement) is scaled equally with a factor. This means that the reinforcement in the compression and tension zone receive the same factor. Optimize existing reinforcement The existing longitudinal reinforcement is divided into upper and lower reinforcement (compression and tensile reinforcement) and is scaled with different factors. This option allows for only required tension reinforcement to be scaled appropriately, while possibly not required reinforcement in the compression zone is set to zero. "
I can't create a new file. The menu item is greyed out. What can I do?,"Please check whether you have started the licensed main program or have accidentally opened the viewer. The viewer is only used to view files and is license-free. If you want to create files, you must start the licensed main program. If there is no longer a link to it, you can copy the link to the viewer and then remove the /Viewer suffix in the properties."
Why do the results in the modal analysis differ between initial prestress and a surface load?,"In the modal analysis settings, a minimum change in length for cables and membranes can be set in order to bring an initial prestress to the objects and thus improve the convergence of the calculation. This initial prestress is applied to the objects in a simplified approach.If you compare this setting with an area load of the length change load type, you must note that the two approaches differ. With the distributed load, you carry out a calculation so that the actual preload can deviate from the specified preload. Other boundary conditions, such as the Poisson's ratio of the material, are also taken into account in the calculation.You can easily control this by varying the Poisson's ratio of the material. A Poisson's ratio other than 0 causes the deformation in the x and y direction of the surface to interact, which no longer leads to a constant stress/strain over the entire surface. If the Poisson's ratio is 0, you will get the same results. "
"Can I switch the required reinforcement from ""mesh points"" to ""grid points"" in the results tables?","Yes, this is possible.To do this, open the settings for the ""Concrete design"" add-on. There you will find the setting for switching from ""Mesh Points"" to ""Grid Points""."
In RFEM 6 I am looking for the line releases known from RFEM 5. These are no longer available in RFEM 6?,"The line releases are not yet available in this form in RFEM 6.In the future, however, you can also define nonlinearities directly for the line hinges.

Backward compatibility from RFEM 6 to RFEM 5 and for RSTAB 9 in RSTAB 8 is not intended. In general, before importing, you should note that RFEM 5 or RSTAB 8 save the model in the latest program version. Currently, most of the model data, load cases and combinations as well as the loads should be importable into the new program series. Unfortunately, objects such as E.g. releases, connections, entries in the additional modules, components of penetrations, generated wind and snow loads and the printout report. We strongly recommend all input data for an import Check and complete if necessary."

What are the minimum requirements for RFEM 6 and RSTAB 9?,"The following computer configurations are required for RFEM 6 and RSTAB 9 as a minimum: RAM RAM: 4 GB Processor CPU: x64 Free mass storage: 10 GB Screen and graphics card resolution: A resolution of at least 1920 x 1080 pixels should be used so that all dialogs, windows and result diagrams are displayed correctly. Operating system: Microsoft Windows 8.1 64-bit Graphics card: Graphics card with a GPU from NVIDIA or AMD with OpenGL 4.2 support ( generally any dedicated GPU released after ~2011). We strongly advise against an integrated GPU, since the drivers often cause problems. RFEM 6 and RSTAB 9 do not run under Linux or Mac OS. The following computer configuration is recommended for using all program capacities: RAM RAM: 64 GB Processor CPU: Intel Core i9-9900K with 8 physical cores or better. The number of cores has a positive effect on the calculation time and the respective individual core performance on the pure program operation and preparation of the graphic data. Use of a solid state drive to achieve shorter access times and higher data rates. Graphics card: A modern ATI or NVIDIA graphics card with OpenGL support (e.g. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 or better).If you are using an Nvidia card on a remote computer, you may need to install an additional tool from Nvidia to enable remotely accelerated OpenGL: https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-opengl-rdpOperating system: Microsoft Windows 10 64 bit The new program generation is designed for the control of 4k monitors. For an optimal user experience, both monitors must be assigned the same scaling. In this case, the computer displays the program sharply and correctly scaled on both monitors. With different scalings, the program is not displayed quite as sharply on a monitor. Since the issue also occurs in regular Windows dialogs, we hope for a possible improvement with Windows 11."
How can I perform an earthquake analysis in RFEM 6 and RSTAB 9?,"To perform an earthquake analysis, you need a modal analysis and then a load case of analysis type Response Spectrum Analysis.After you have performed your modal analysis, create your new load case. There you will find the usual settings from the previous program generation. In the Response range tab you can define your response range as usual. If you want to access a range of responses according to the standard, you must ensure that the desired standard is selected in the general information of standards II. In the Choice of Shapes tab, you can select eigenshapes again and filter them if necessary. When you have calculated the load case, you get to the result output. "
How can I display mode shapes in RFEM 6 and RSTAB 9?,"In order to look at eigenmodes of your dynamic analysis, you must create a load case of the analysis type modal analysis and make your settings for the modal analysis there. After you have started the calculation, you can evaluate your results in the result navigator. Further information is also available in the table. "
How can I open RWIND via the load assistant in RSTAB and RFEM?,"So that RWIND appears in the load assistant of RSTAB 9 or RFEM 6, the add-on must first be activated via the basic model data in the Add-Ons tab. Then the input can be made in the wind simulation settings under ""Load cases and combinations"" and Settings for the wind profile and the load cases to be generated are made in the load assistant. "
Where can I find the materials for the corresponding national annexes in RFEM 6 and RSTAB 9?,"In order to make the material library more compact and clearer, the materials of the individual national annexes, as listed in RFEM 5 and RSTAB 8, were replaced by a single material in the new programs. Since the materials are identical anyway, with a few exceptions, the material according to CEN is now offered for the design. To do this, select the 'European Union' region.Materials from this region can be used in the corresponding design add-ons, regardless of the national appendix set for the design code. If deviations are defined in the respective national appendix, these are taken into account on the design page."

How many cores can RFEM 6 address for the calculation?,"In theory, all cores can be used to solve multiple analyzes in parallel. However, it also depends on free physical memory, analysis dependencies, etc. The calculation of RFEM benefits from multiple calculation cores. However, it is true here that more cores are not always better. If the calculation is distributed over a large number of cores, then the data traffic increases and the connections between the cores and the memory are becoming more and more of a bottleneck. Processors from Intel are generally recommended. Unfortunately, we have not yet had any personal experience with the Ryzen processors. Modern processors have a sophisticated temperature management system. The clock frequency is dynamically adjusted depending on the temperature in the processor. This means that good cooling of the processor can improve performance. That's why we recommend a generously dimensioned computer case and a good fan for the processor."
Can I import a SHAPE-THIN cross-section into RFEM 6 or RSTAB 9?,"Yes, this is possible.However, you need the RSECTION program for this. Existing SHAPE-THIN files can be opened in RSECTION.

How can I speed up the work in RSTAB 9 and RFEM 6 when creating a new file?,"Templates can be created very easily with RSTAB 9 and RFEM 6. The easiest way to do this is to create a new file and create all the desired configurations. This file can then be saved via ""File → Save as template..."".In this way, several standardized templates can be easily created. A big advantage of using templates is that settings such as e.g. For example, the material used, numbering on/off, language, etc. must be set when creating a new style.A good template should contain the following components: Frequently used materialsFrequently used cross-sectionsSpecial frequently used hinges (member and line hinges)A list of commonly used loads, such as Dead weight, permanent load, wind and snowA printout report with your own configurationsSome standard views of the model: 3D iso, front view in Y directionIn addition, the following settings are also usually quite helpful:Bar orientations ON/OFFDisplay of self-weight ON/OFFNumbering ON/OFFGlobal coordinate system X,Y,Z (in the fixed point) ON/OFFColors of the rendered objects afterdeformations of members in Colors"

This takes you directly to the settings for the selected object."
"What is the reason for the colors for compression and tension being swapped in RSTAB 9 and RFEM 6 in relation to older program versions? Since then, pressure has been red and tension blue. ","The result colors for the member components have been adjusted to the multicolor display of the surface results. The multicolor display is based on a color spectrum that runs from blue to red. Blue represents the minimum and red the maximum. Accordingly, the two-color representation of member results now shows negative values in blue and positive values in red. When switching to the multicolored bar results display, this logic also applies and small (negative) values remain in the lower blue segment of the spectrum and large (positive) values in the upper red segment of the spectrum."
I have a model with intersecting line releases/joints and am getting implausible results.,"In general, crossing releases with different definitions represent a contradiction, so that the higher-level release is valid at this point. "

"When trying to import an IFC file into RFEM, I get an error message. How can I solve the problem?","In RFEM6 we use a 3rd party tool (IFCOpenShell) to read IFC files and convert the text into objects.RFEM6 shows you the import log after importing an IFC file. In many cases you will see errors . The error messages are generated by the tool, not directly by us. So if the tool thinks that an entity is incorrectly defined in that IFC file, it will mention it there. If this is the case, an object (wall, column,...) may not be displayed after import. As an example, a wall is to be imported. However, this is not displayed in RFEM6 (IFC file attached). However, the error does not accurately describe the problem. It roughly points in the direction of the cause. If you need more information, you can use a validation tool developed by IfcOpenShell. You can follow the steps below to use it: Download Python from the Windows App Store (if you don't have python, just type ""python"" without the """" in the cmd line and the App Store should appear). Download the related IfcOpenShell Python module from this page: https://blenderbim.org/docs-python/ifcopenshell-python/installation.html Extract the contents to the ""site- packages"" folder of your Python distribution (you can find this folder by putting the following command in the cmd line: python -m site --user-site Open the cmd line and paste the following command: python -m ifcopenshell.validate ""path of your ifc file"" As a result, you will get more information about the problem: You can use both messages (from the log file and the Python tool) to point out the problem directly. In the case of the example, no surface was imported. The reason was that a piece of information was missing in #36 IFCFaceSurface. However, the RFEM warning only referred to #43 ""IfcTopologyRepresentation"". "
Can I create a visibility from objects even though the feature is greyed out?,"Yes, this is very easy to do with a small detour. You can do this with the help of Excel for any objects that you can specifically select with the Select function.Export the desired worksheet to Excel. In our example, we want to select all members that contain input for form-finding.In Excel, you can then use the TEXTLINKED formula to display all member numbers with the comma as a separator in one line as a continuous list. You can copy this list and then add the desired objects to your selection using the Select function, thereby creating visibility. "
"There is no ""imperfection"" action category. How can an imperfection load case be created?","This action category no longer exists in RFEM 6 and RSTAB 9.

"Is it possible to define member non-linearities for beam members? Is it possible, for example, to define a member that can absorb all internal forces, except for example normal pressure forces? Why does the bending moment curve in the oblique beam differ from my manual calculation? Normally no bending moments should be calculated there.","Yes, to do this, activate the ""Nonlinearity"" tab in the ""New Member/Edit Member"" dialog box. A new member nonlinearity can then be defined in the ""Nonlinearity"" tab. The reason for the occurrence of a bending moment in the oblique and straight beams is that the central support has a certain flexibility due to its [[http://www.seznam.cz]] rigidity. Compression occurs at the middle support, so that the deformation of the middle support also affects the right transom REFERENCE [2]. Because the right bar is additionally held on a movable support,[[http://www.seznam.cz a constraining moment arises at this]] point. You can see it above all from the respective deformations. The deformation is decisive for the creation of the bending moment in the right part of the system. The calculation using RFEM results in minimal bending moments, which are not taken into account in the manual calculation. REFERENCE [1] test"
Why do I get the error message 10203 in the design for the result member with RF-CONCRETE Members?,"In RF-CONCRETE Members, in the ""1.6 Reinforcement"" window, on the ""Fire Protection"" tab, you can select the approach of a precamber due to temperature difference. A member load is then generated internally for the calculation as a precamber of the cross-section.However, the resulting member is a virtual member without any rigidity and without considering a support, which is not designed to absorb loads. An error message is therefore displayed when the calculation is started if the precamber due to temperature difference is to be taken into account in RF-CONCRETE Members for the design of result members."
Why is there no support force displayed although I have bedded the member?,"If the model contains elastically embedded members, the contact forces and contact moments are displayed numerically in Table 4.7.

How can I find overlapping elements and clean up the modelling?,"Elements that are completely or partially overlapping in their length can be found with the model check for overlapping elements. The model control is called via menu Extras → Model control → Overlapping elements.If the control detects overlapping elements, these are displayed in a dialog sorted by groups. The current group is marked by an arrow in the working window. The element pairs can be exported to MS Excel or created as visibility. With the visibilities generated in this way, the relevant elements in the profile can be found and deleted very quickly. "
Can a model be adjusted after it has been created with the model generator?,"After creating a model with the model generator, it is not possible to subsequently adjust the model using the model generator.However, the dialog entries of the model generator can be saved as a template and used again later. This allows adjustments to be made to the sample that has been read in, and the model can thus be recreated. "
"Why do I get the message ""Invalid material"" in the RF/-STEEL Members add-on module when using stainless steels?","Since several yield points are stored in the material for stainless steels (0.2% yield point and 1.0% yield point) and, strictly speaking, the additional module does not take any standard into account in the design, but only performs a pure stress analysis, the Users actively decide for themselves by manually specifying the yield point.

I get the message that my material does not meet the requirements of the current standard. How can I correct this?,"You can generally create and use your own materials. When entering in the material library, however, it must be ensured that the materials can also be used in the additional modules: The specific weight has an influence on the design and on the formulas there. If you set the specific gravity to 0 when creating the custom material, that material cannot be dimensioned in the plug-in. The specific gravity of the material should be used when creating e.g. B. can only be adjusted directly in the material library for lightweight concrete. If you do not want to consider the specific weight and thus the self-weight as loads, you can set this to 0 in the ""Edit material"" dialog. "

"When evaluating the line supports in result combinations, you can choose an average for the ""sum of the result combination"" and the ""displayed mean values"". What does the Sum of Result Combinations function entail?","The easiest way to explain the function is with an example. This sample file can be downloaded at the end of this FAQ under ""Downloads"". In load case 1, the following support reaction results for the ""actual progression"": Also in load case 1, the following curve results with ""smooth distribution"" (constant): In load case 2, ""Actual"" results in the following course: Im The next step is to consider an additive EK with the following definition:EK 1 = LF1/s or LF2/s If you now look at the ""Sum of the result combination"" setting, you get the following curve for EK1: LF1 ... smoothed value = 5 kN/m ... here the max value of EK1 LF2 .. . smoothed value = 4 kN/m ... here the min value of the EK1 Now we switch to the maximum value of EK1 and the actual course of the bearing reactions in the results navigator: The mean value of the values is no longer 5.0 kN/m, but now 5.80 kN/m. If you now set the min value of the EK1 with the option ""Average value of the displayed values"", the result is a value of 3.2 kN/m instead of the 4.0 kN/m described above. So the setting in the Show navigator has an impact on the averaging of the results from additive EKs."
"When performing the fire protection analysis with HOLZ Pro, I get error 10001. How can the error be rectified?","If this error message is displayed, the cross-section is obviously not sufficient, since there is no residual cross-section after the defined fire resistance period. You can check this very easily by reducing the fire resistance duration in the detailed settings until proof is just possible. In the result of the fire protection certificate, you can see very clearly in the graphic how much residual cross-section is still available after the set fire duration. "
How to enter the temperature difference for a T-beam defined as a rib?,"In RSTAB and RFEM, the ""Temperature difference"" load type always refers to the cross-section height. For a rib, however, the plate portion is not taken into account for determining the section height, which is required for determining the load size. For a rib it is therefore necessary to define the loading for the member and for the surface separately.ExampleAssumptions:Cross-section Rib → Rectangle 200/200Surface thickness → 200 mmTemperature difference between the top and bottom of the component = 200 KResult for the deformation during modelling of the component as a T-beam (cross-section) The load for the model using surfaces and ribs is made up as follows: The temperature load of the surface is also determined according to exactly this scheme. The attached model file contains two further modeling variants in which the temperature curve for the plate portion was considered a little more realistically. The deformations in these two model variants are slightly larger for this example than in the other models. "

"In the RWIND Simulation program, how does the input of the turbulence intensity relate to the profile of the turbulence intensity?","In the background, the profile of the turbulence intensity over the altitude is a pure factor function dependent on the altitude. Multiplying the height-dependent factors with the entered turbulence intensity results in the turbulence intensity profile applied at the wind tunnel entrance. The generic turbulence intensity profiles from the RFEM 5 or RSTAB 8 environment are each referenced to the lower edge of the wind tunnel. The factor function therefore has the value 1 at this point on the ground and thus determines the unmodified input value of the turbulence intensity at this point. At a higher point with a factor ≠ 1, the turbulence intensity input multiplied by this factor is applied accordingly. "
"How can you use the COM interface, e.g. B. Delete all nodes or members in a model?","For deleting elements there is the ""DeleteObjects()"" function in the model data interface.

Why does the vertical position of a result bar in my model not affect the bending moment My of the bar?,"The change in the vertical position or an eccentricity only causes a difference in the bending moment My if other forces are acting on the model that also influence this moment, such as a normal force in the following example. A slab mounted as a single-span beam is only loaded vertically on the left side of the picture. The bending moments of the result bars, which are positioned above and below the slab, do not differ.On the right side, the slab is additionally loaded by a normal force. This gives the result members additional negative or positive moments. The eccentricity acts as a lever arm. "
Can I keep the results from RWIND Simulation when deleting the FE mesh if I only adjust materials or storage conditions?,"Yes it is possible. You can keep the RWIND Simulation results when the FE mesh is deleted. To do this, activate the Retain results of RWIND Simulation if the mesh is deleted: Es option in the RWIND Simulation settings no new calculation is required by RWIND Simulation if the material is changed, the storage conditions are adjusted or other changes are made that do not affect the CFD analysis.After adjusting the material, the FE mesh deleted and thus also the RWIND load case.

How are the signs to be interpreted for the release results of the line release and line joints?,"line joint is nothing more than a line release where an object is released. While a surface is released with the line release, this is defined on the line of a surface with the line joints. In this case, the released surface is the surface on which the line hinge was defined. The forces always act on the original surface, i.e. on the non-released surface. In the case of line hinges, this means that the forces act on the surface without a line hinge. Now the sign conventions need to be clarified, i.e. in which direction the force acts on the surface . To do this, it is necessary to know the local x-axis of the lines and the local z-axis of the area. The internal line hinge coordinate system is to be understood as follows: The x' axis points in the direction of the local x-axis of the line.The z' axis is the normal to the surface on which the line hinge was defined.The y' axis represents the tangent to the surface plane and results via the ""right-hand rule"". this means the following: Example 1The x-axis of the line goes right.The z-axis of the area is oriented down⇒ The y' axis of the line hinge is oriented away from the original surface (= surface without line hinge). Since the value is output with a negative sign, the force acts in the direction of the original surface. Example 2The x-axis of the line runs left.The z-axis of the surface is oriented down⇒ The y' axis of the line joint is oriented to the original surface (= surface without line joint). Since the value is output with a positive sign, the force acts in the direction of the original surface. Example 3The x-axis of the line runs to the right.The z-axis of the surface is oriented downwards⇒ The y' axis of the Line joint is oriented towards the original surface (= surface without line joint). Since the value is output with a positive sign, the force acts in the direction of the original surface because action = reaction. Example 1 The x-axis of the line runs to left.The z-axis of the area is to down oriented⇒ The y' axis of the line hinge is oriented away from the original surface (= surface without line hinge) . Since the value is output with a negative sign, the force acts in the direction of the original surface because Action = Reactio. Unlike the line releases, the axis system can unfortunately not be used for the line joints not be displayed. For the example shown in the picture, it is advisable not to arrange the line hinge on the surface on which the result is to be related and to orient the x-axis of the line in such a way that its y-axis is oriented in the direction of the desired surface. The coordinate system of the line then applies to this."
How can the colors of the selection and preselection be changed?,"The colors of the selection and preselection can be changed within the display properties:Menu bar ""Options"" → ""Display properties"" → ""Edit"" or context menu (right-click on work plane) → Display properties Colors → Miscellaneous → Selection / preselection "
How can I create a curved or curved section?,"To do this, a line of the desired shape must first be created in the area at the point where the cut is to be made. The cut can then be arranged along this line. If no element with a rigidity is connected to this line and no load is applied, the mesh generator must first be informed that this line should nevertheless be meshed. After the calculation, the results can be read. If you are shown two result curves, it is because the result is shown from both sides of the line. In this case, you can set the smoothing of the internal forces to ""Continuous total"". Then these are smoothed over the lines and only a result curve remains."

The add-on module now generates 20 load cases, with activated random torsion 40 load cases. The number of generated load cases increases significantly with an increase in the eigenmodes to be calculated. You should therefore always ensure that you keep the number of eigenmodes as small as possible. However, it often happens that a mode shape with a high effective modal mass factor comes only after many mode shapes with small effective masses. For such cases there is the possibility to deselect the shapes that have a small effective modal mass factor in the ""Dynamic load cases"" → ""Mode shapes"" tab. The operation of the option is shown in the linked video. It is strongly recommended to use this option in all models with many mode shapes. The threshold at which forms are canceled can be changed at will and adapted to the specific situation."
Can I let generated member loads from area loads act eccentrically on the member profile using a plane?,"Yes, this is possible in RFEM. However, to do this, you must disconnect the generated load. The generated loads are converted into normal member loads and can be changed as required. After separating, you can specify a load eccentricity.As expected, the member loads generate a torsional moment if they act eccentrically to the shear center. Possibilities for RSTAB are described in the FAQ 2361 ."
Why are my imperfections displayed differently graphically and can I customize the display?,"As already described in the FAQ 4386, imperfections in the graphic are always aligned to a support.If no member is connected to a support, the display may differ. For example, if you are working with member schedules, you can Reverse the member orientation in the Edit Imperfection dialog and check whether the graphical representation is then visually the same. Since the graphic imperfection is in fact an equivalent load, the representation in this case is only of visual relevance. "
Is it also possible to specify a longitudinal reinforcement manually for the design in RF-PUNCH Pro?,"Yes, in the RF-PUNCH Pro add-on module, the desired longitudinal reinforcement can be defined in the ""1.5 Punching Node"" window within the details. If the minimum moments are to be taken into account when calculating the reinforcement for columns, this can also be done in the module according to FAQ 004371."
What happens to the programs and add-ons when the network license times out? And how can I increase the timeout time?,"The timeout is reset with each license request (e.g. start of calculation, save). The license is released after 12 hours of inactivity (e.g. no start of the calculation, no saving). If the time limit is exceeded during the calculation , the license is released. When additional module calculations are started automatically, the licenses of the corresponding additional modules are occupied and released again after the calculation is complete. Saved by the user after the calculation and no license is free, a corresponding message is output. If a license is available again, the saving process can be started again. The time limit can be set in the Admin Control Center under ""Configuration"". "
"After the design with RF-/TIMBER Pro, I had a cross-section optimized. Why is the utilization of the optimized cross-section now exceeded?","The optimization of cross-sections in RF-/TIMBER Pro is based solely on the ultimate limit state (ULS), not on the serviceability limit state (SLS), see image from the RF-TIMBER Pro manual. More information on optimizing cross sections can be found in the RF-TIMBER Pro Manual on the sides 69 - 71 in the German version and on pages 76 - 78 in the English version (can also be called using the F1 key in the additional module). "
Is it possible to verify the bearing pressure or the sleeper pressure in RX-TIMBER?,"In the ""Geometry"" or ""Supports and Hinges"" mask, in the ""Supports"" tab, you can specify whether the bearing pressure check should be carried out for a support. With an asymmetrical system, separate inputs are possible, for example for the bearing at the ridge. In this way, the different bearing widths of the two rafters can be recorded. If there is a rafter notch, the reduction in cross-section is usually known (column D). The supports can be ""Global"". the directions of the axes XYZ or ""Local"" are related to the directions of the member axes xyz. The corresponding selection is possible in the list.The bearing orientation has, among other things, an effect on the verification of the bearing pressure: With a global arrangement, the compressive stresses in the notch are taken into account according to the roof pitch at an angle to the grain direction, with a local arrangement at 90° to the grain. "
"Can I use the ""Isotropic Nonlinear Elastic 1D"" material model to simulate the cracked state of a concrete section for a bending beam?","No, the ""Isotropic nonlinear elastic 1D"" material model is not suitable for a bending beam, since the nonlinear stress distribution over the height of the cross section cannot be represented here. The reason for this is that there are no stress points/FE mesh points over the height of the cross-section. This means that no cracking of the cross-section can be simulated.The ""Isotropic nonlinear elastic 1D"" material model would be suitable for cracking of the entire cross-section under pure normal force stress, but not for bending and compression.For the simulation of a cross-section subjected to bending stress in a cracked state, only a non-linear design with RF-CONCRETE Members and the Module extension RF-BETON NL. Creep and shrinkage can be taken into account with the module extension in RF-CONCRETE Members.After the calculation, the nonlinear stiffness of the cross-section can be imported back into RFEM and a new internal force determination can be performed taking into account the cracked concrete cross-section You can find further details on this procedure under the following links:https://www.dlubal.com/de/support-und-schulungen/support/faq/002881 https://www.dlubal.com/ de/support-und-schulungen/support/knowledge-base/000992"
"Why is it not possible to select a load case for design in the RF-/STEEL add-on module, even though it is defined in RFEM/RSTAB?","The calculation of the corresponding load case in RFEM/RSTAB may have been deactivated. After activation, the load case should be available for selection in the add-on module. "
"Why aren't the stresses of the 90° orientation displayed in RF-LAMINATE for a layer with the orthotropy direction 90° for σb,90?","The indices of the stresses from RF-LAMINATE, such as σb,90 here, do not refer to the local surface axis system from RFEM, but to the orthotropy directions that are defined in RF-LAMINATE in the mask "" 1.2 - Material properties"" have been defined. The orthotropy directions can be displayed graphically by activating the Show navigator. The red arrow represents here the ""zero direction"" of stress, that is, the direction of stress σb,0. The The colors of the arrows can be adjusted within the display properties (category General, Axis system, Surface axis systems x, y, z (orthotropy directions)). Accordingly, for each orthotropy direction of a layer defined in RF-LAMINATE, the stress σb,0 in this direction applies, for the stress perpendicular to the defined orthotropy directions σb,90 applies."
Why does the deflection of the reinforced concrete slab sometimes increase when choosing a larger base reinforcement?,"The effect results from the shrinkage approach in the nonlinear deformation calculation in RF-CONCRETE surfaces. Shrinkage is taken into account as a change in length or shortening in the form of an additional load. Because the reinforcement prevents shrinkage, with an asymmetrical reinforcement of e.g. B. 2.57 cm²/m above and 5.24 cm²/m below shorten the cross-section on the upper side more because of the smaller steel core. This gives you an additional curvature (bottom longer) that occurs in addition to the actual deformation. If the difference between the steel cross-sections on the top and bottom is even greater (e.g. 2.57 cm²/m above and 10.47 cm²/m below), this additional curvature also increases. Man can create additional design cases in the file and, for example, examine a symmetrical reinforcement or switch off shrinkage as a test. You can find further information on approaching shrinkage in the nonlinear deformation calculation in Article 001574 on our homepage."
We are looking for software that can be used to calculate and measure scaffolding or shelving structures. Is this possible with programs from Dlubal Software?,"RFEM or RSTAB form an ideal basis for the calculation of scaffolding or racks, e.g. B. Shelving systems or high-bay warehouses. For both programs, additional modules for standards are available with which steel, aluminum and lightweight structures can be calculated and designed.

How can the height of the concrete compression zone be viewed in RF-/CONCRETE?,"In RF-/CONCRETE Members, the height of the concrete compression zone can be viewed within the intermediate results of the ""4.1 - Serviceability Limit State Design"" window. The output takes place within the printout report when activated accordingly.In RF-CONCRETE Surfaces, the height of the concrete compression zone is only determined if the cross-section is cracked. It can be viewed in the ""3.1 - Serviceability limit state"" window in the calculation details of a point. The calculation details can be exported using the Excel button become."
"If I don't specify a basic reinforcement in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces, I get the value X as additional required reinforcement. If I enter this value X as the existing basic reinforcement, I correctly do not receive any additionally required reinforcement.However, if I enter a lower value than the determined required total reinforcement as basic reinforcement, the additionally required reinforcement increases so that the originally required reinforcement content is exceeded. Why?","Please check the concrete covers of the basic reinforcement and the additional reinforcement. In this case, a higher concrete cover is probably defined for the additional reinforcement than for the basic reinforcement.If the existing basic reinforcement is so low that additional reinforcement is required, but there is a lower static useful height due to the higher concrete cover adjust the program accordingly, i.e. increase the reinforcement content.Accordingly, the concrete covers in window 1.4 ""Reinforcement, tab Reinforcement layout"" must be taken into account accordingly. "
Does the load generation also work for bent members?,"No, the load generation such as ""Area load on members using plane"" only works for straight or multi-part straight members. Bent members can be converted into polygonal members as follows, if required:Split a bent member using the desired number of intermediate nodes (Right-click on member → Split member)Select all bent membersChange the line type in the table from ""arc"" to ""polyline""If necessary, use the ""Show only selected objects"" function,Change the top linetype in the tableSelect all rows → right click → ""Set"" Generate load"
Why does the RF-CONCRETE Surfaces add-on module not increase the amount of reinforcement until the SLS checks show a utilization factor of 1.0?,"The automatic increase in reinforcement for the SLS is based on the assumption of a lever arm, which is also used for the ULS calculation. However, increasing the lever arm can change it. This occurs in particular when the required reinforcement is applied with a different diameter than for the ULS or in a different position.At the end of the calculation, however, the module performs another check with the automatically designed one reinforcement. The actual position of the reinforcement is then taken into account in this verification. This can lead to a mostly minor overrun.Since the utilization is set to one decimal place by default, the overrun may appear more dramatic than it is. In the module under ""Settings"" → ""Units and decimal places..."" you can also set two decimal places."

What effects can the renumbering of elements have on the printout report and the additional modules?,"With regard to the printout report, user-defined views can be influenced by renumbering. Renumbering also affects the module data. For example, if you have selected bar 1 for design in a module and then renumber the bars, you will most likely design the wrong bar. For this reason, we strongly recommend that you that a renumbering takes place before you start working in the additional modules."
How can I increase the minimum shear reinforcement in RF-CONCRETE surfaces?,"The minimum of the inserted shear reinforcement can be controlled via two settings:Mask 1.4 - Reinforcement degrees - Minimum shear reinforcement degreeMask 1.4 - Depending on the standard, eg for DIN EN 1992-1-1 - Minimum shear reinforcementIt should also be noted with the minimum shear reinforcement according to DIN EN 1992-1-1 that the width-height ratio of the entire slab is meant in the mask. Since RF-CONCRETE Surfaces is suitable for any surface and the individual FE elements are designed, this ratio must be determined and entered manually by the user."

According to EN 1995-1-1 2.2.2(1)P, for example, calculations can be made using the design values for the stiffness property of the component, i.e. using the stiffness divided by the partial safety factor. For this reason, this stiffness modification is activated by default. Of course, there should be no reduction in stiffness for the load combinations in the serviceability limit state.Manual creation of load combinationsIf the load combinations are created manually, a load combination cannot ""know"" which one limit state it is. In this case, the user must make the setting manually. This setting must also be deactivated manually when switching to first-order theory.Automatic generation of load combinationsIf the load combinations are automatically generated by the program, then for the Timber construction-specific SLS combinations automatically deactivates the reduction in stiffness. Depending on the type of calculation, the reduction is taken into account for the ULS combinations (II. order and higher) or not (theory I. order). However, this requires the calculation type to be defined in the combination rules. Changing the calculation type in the calculation parameters of the LK has no effect on the stiffness."
How to simulate an inflatable body in RFEM?,"An inflatable body usually consists of an air-filled foil bag with internal and external stiffening elements.

How is creep and shrinkage considered for columns in RF-CONCRETE Members?,"Regarding the consideration of creep and shrinkage, the program concept is as follows: In RF-CONCRETE Members, creep and shrinkage are only considered when there is a curvature and when the cross-section is cracked open. There is an explanation for this in the manual, see Chapter 2.4.5.2. The concept for determining the longitudinal stiffness is designed for curved components. In the case of purely axial stress, the program is not able to determine the exact deformation associated with creep and shrinkage according to the current concept."
Why do I get such a small amount of reinforcement for my cover? The amount of reinforcement for the beams is significantly larger.,"While rod 1 represents an overlay, rod 2 is a downstand. This results in a normal compressive force for bar 1, while a tensile force results for bar 2.A compressed cross-section is better for concrete design than a stretched cross-section. Here are the normal forces of the members for comparison: If you switch off the normal forces for the design in RF-CONCRETE Members, the required reinforcement results the curve is affine to the moment curve: With this setting, you are on the safe side for the design of member 1, but on the safe side with member 2 insecure site."
"In my model, I have to consider construction stages with non-linearities, so I have to work with load combinations that already include the self-weight.I have several load combinations for the first and then also for the second construction stage to examine and evaluate.The load combinations from the first construction stage no longer occur in the second construction stage.It is not clear to me how the load combinations in the construction stages are to be assigned (permanent or temporary ). ","With RF-STAGES, the ""permanent"" loads are applied to the system. This means that their influence is automatically included in the next construction stage. For this reason, you cannot select the loads a second time. Instead of working with load combinations, you can also work directly with load cases. This means that a permanent LF would then be e.g. B. the dead weight. As soon as variable loads are then added as ""temporary"" loads, the combinatorics can be done (manually) in RF-STAGES itself and then exported for design. There are on the topic ""Consideration of construction stages in RF-STAGES"" already an interesting webinar. "

"have studied two models of an inclined bored pile as a support with a defined spring stiffness. A surface that can be moved horizontally (globally) is used for power transmission. The bored pile in model A is a 15° inclined support with a spring stiffness of 2000 kN/m in the axial direction. The bored pile of model B represents a support with defined spring stiffnesses, divided into the respective horizontal and vertical components. The spring stiffness value is the same in each case (2000 kN/m). In my opinion, the two models are equivalent. Why do different results still occur in the deformation?","In principle, a support with a defined spring stiffness acts like a pendulum support. The ""spring"" member type is used here to better illustrate the situation. It has the same effect in the program as a support with a defined spring stiffness. In this case, model A is an inclined pendulum support, which ideally only absorbs normal forces. In model B, the inclined pendulum support divided into two components, resulting in a one-hip frame. Since the surface of both models can be displaced horizontally (globally), a deflection occurs that in the pendulum support in model A shows a higher deformation than in the one-hip, stabilizing frame in model B. The same deformations can therefore only occur in the two models if the surface is perpendicular to its plane, the means without lateral deflection, is loaded. "

I have a question about the results of the serviceability limit state analysis: How do you explain the increase in dead load by a factor of 1.8 and in live load by a factor of 1.48 in the result combinations for the SLS analysis?,"These increases result from the creep components in the quasi-continuous combination. You can find an overview of the combinations to be examined in the serviceability limit state according to DIN EN 1995-1-1 here or in the links of the FAQ. The creep parts are then simply e.g. B. with 0.8 x self-weight added to the characteristic deformation. This then results in the coefficient 1.8 (see also Chapter 2.2.3 in EN 1995-1-1). In the specific case, for the quasi- For a permanent design situation, the following coefficients should therefore be applied: Gk ⋅ (1 + 0.8) + Qk ⋅ (1 + 0.6 ⋅ 0.8) = Gk ⋅ 1.8 + Qk ⋅ 1.48 "
Is it also possible to measure interrupted weld seams in the CRANE RAILWAY add-on module?,"Yes, that is possible. The Interrupted weld seams option is suitable for cases where the weld seam between the crane rail and the flange is not continuous. An opposite arrangement is assumed.

"Sufficient reinforcement cannot be determined with the add-on module RF-CONCRETE Columns. In a comparative calculation, however, the supports can be verified without any problems. Can you help us?","line joint is nothing more than a line release where an object is released. While a surface is released with the line release, this is defined on the line of a surface with the line joints. In this case, the released surface is the surface on which the line hinge was defined. The forces always act on the original surface, i.e., on the non-released surface. In the case of line hinges, this means that the forces act on the surface without a line hinge. Now the sign conventions need to be clarified, i.e., in which direction the force acts on the surface. To do this, it is necessary to know the local x-axis of the lines and the local z-axis of the area. The internal line hinge coordinate system is to be understood as follows: The x' axis points in the direction of the local x-axis of the line. The z' axis is the normal to the surface on which the line hinge was defined. The y' axis represents the tangent to the surface plane and results via the ""right-hand rule"". This means the following: Example 1The x-axis of the line goes right. The z-axis of the area is oriented down⇒ The y' axis of the line hinge is oriented away from the original surface (= surface without line hinge). Since the value is output with a negative sign, the force acts in the direction of the original surface. Example 2The x-axis of the line runs left. The z-axis of the surface is oriented down⇒ The y' axis of the line joint is oriented to the original surface (= surface without line joint). Since the value is output with a positive sign, the force acts in the direction of the original surface. Example 3The x-axis of the line runs to the right. The z-axis of the surface is oriented downwards⇒ The y' axis of the Line joint is oriented towards the original surface (= surface without line joint). Since the value is output with a positive sign, the force acts in the direction of the original surface because action = reaction. Example 1 The x-axis of the line runs to left. The z-axis of the area is to down oriented⇒ The y' axis of the line hinge is oriented away from the original surface (= surface without line hinge). Since the value is output with a negative sign, the force acts in the direction of the original surface because Action = Reaction. Unlike the line releases, the axis system can unfortunately not be used for the line joints not be displayed. For the example shown in the picture, it is advisable not to arrange the line hinge on the surface on which the result is to be related and to orient the x-axis of the line in such a way that its y-axis is oriented in the direction of the desired surface. The coordinate system of the line then applies to this."
How do you differentiate between response spectra with equivalent loads and response spectra without equivalent loads in RFEM and RSTAB?,"The difference between the equivalent loads and the response spectrum method are the equivalent loads themselves. With the equivalent load method, these are generated in each FE node and written to a separate load case. With the response spectrum method methods, on the other hand, the internal forces are calculated immediately and output as a result. For an earthquake calculation, we can therefore recommend the calculation using equivalent loads. Here you have practically no disadvantages compared to the response spectrum method and you can also use the Consider random torsional effects. "
"In a buckling safety analysis, FE-BUCKLING determines a decisive shear stress of τ=7.45 kN/cm², while in RF-/STEEL a maximum shear stress of τ=8.20 kN/cm² results. Where does this difference come from?","In most cases, slender beams receive a parabolic shear stress in the web of the cross-section, which has its maximum value in the center of gravity in the case of doubly symmetrical cross-sections. According to DIN 18800 Part 3, Section 403, the following applies:Shear stresses that vary over the width b of the buckling panel are to be taken into account with the larger of the following two values:Mean value of τ0 ,5 max τIn this case, the mean value of the shear stress is used for the buckling safety verification.Because the variable shear stress τz from static moment Sy, there is a table in FE-BUCKLING about details of c/t-parts of cross-section. This also includes the mean static moments, which in cases like this are used to determine the corresponding shear stresses for the buckling safety verification according to the usual formula, but with an average static moment. Accordingly, the following shear stress results in FE-BUCKLING. The respective static moments, with which the shear stresses are determined in RF-/STEEL for the stress analysis, can be viewed in the results mask via the ""Show cross-section values and stresses expanded"" button."
How can I read out the resultant of a cut via the COM interface?,"Just like all other results, the resultant of a section can be read out via IModel3 → ICalculation2 → IResults2.

"am trying to import a model from cadwork. Unfortunately, I am not able to correctly transfer the cross-sections from cadwork to RFEM. Do you have a tip?","In times of BIM, data exchange between the individual disciplines of structural design and execution is becoming increasingly important. Since each software has its own specifications, also with regard to the designations of cross-sections and materials, RFEM and RSTAB offer conversion tables that can be accessed in the ""Detailed Settings"" tab of the import and export dialog. The material and profile designations for the import and export can be defined there. Dlubal's own designations can be easily selected from the extensive material and cross-section library. If necessary, the conversion tables can be easily distributed to every workplace in the office. Cadwork and RFEM should be able to handle the cross-sections reciprocally if they are correctly defined in the conversion table . In order to ensure that the names match, we recommend the following procedure: Create and export the cross section in cadwork. Open the .stp file with the editor and check which designation is used for the cross section. Enter this designation in the RFEM conversion table. "
"If the specified crack width of z. B. wk = 0.3 mm also proven for the primary cracks? According to the manual, an average elongation is taken into account.

This method is based on the approach of average strain according to equation (7.9) . With this theoretical approach, only the crack width of primary cracks is determined. The crack distance (sr,max) describes the theoretical distance to the next primary crack and at the same time represents the length over which the difference in strain is considered and ultimately the crack width is calculated."

"When I import a model directly from AutoCAD, the shape of the ""spline"" is sometimes incorrect.","In AutoCAD you can create two different types of SPLINES - either with fit points or control vertices. RFEM supports the former. These are imported as B-Spline lines. The second line type, on the other hand, actually corresponds to the NURBS lines. Although these can be modeled in RFEM 5, the interface does not support this type. The control vertices are used as ""fit points"" for defining a B-spline. This results in a different shape. Modifying the corresponding lines is a workaround. The line type Bezier spline is probably best suited here."

"When modeling a beam connection to a continuous column, I have the problem that the column flange fails on bending. If I now add shims to the RAHMECK Pro add-on module, none of the utilization rates change. Why is that?","The placement of shims in the column only increases the resistance of a bolt-row where failure mode 1 (full yielding of the flange without bolt failure) is governing. This is probably not the case in your example, ie failure mode 2 is decisive: Here the shims do not increase the connection load-bearing capacity of the frame corner.More information on this topic can be found in the relevant section of DIN EN 1993-1- 8, which serves as the basis for the calculation in RAHMECK Pro. When using shims, the geometry specifications according to Section 6.2.4.3 of the above-mentioned standard must also be observed."
How is the buckling load determined in RSBUCK if the most unfavorable value is taken from RSTAB for a non-constant axial force curve?,"Basically, the buckling load is determined as follows when the option to accept the most unfavorable value of the normal force is activated with a non-constant curve: Cracking load factor * most unfavorable value of the normal force = buckling load The most unfavorable However, value refers to the staff part, not the entire staff. The value of the most unfavorable axial force of the entire member is therefore only assumed as the most unfavorable value if ""1"" is selected for ""Internal member division for"" the respective member. Otherwise, the program will first determine the mean value from the most unfavorable values of the respective member divisions. The following most unfavorable value for two member parts results from the normal force curve (60 kN + 30 kN) / 2 = 45 kN This results in the following buckling load for the first buckling figure in this example:2,429 * 45 kN = 109.3 kN"
"How does RF-STABILITY or RSBUCK determine the buckling load?

Is it possible to renumber cross-sections and materials in RFEM and RSTAB?,"Cross-sections and materials cannot be renumbered directly in RFEM or RSTAB.A small detour has to be carried out here. The following example is intended to show the renumbering of cross-sections using Excel tables:First, the selected areas ""Cross-sections"" and ""Members"" are exported as an Excel table. Since members are linked to a cross-section, they must also be changed. The cross sections are then renumbered correctly in Excel. These must also be correctly assigned to the members. The filter option can help here. After Both tables must be imported again into RFEM or RSTAB after editing. "

How can I teach the program to automatically increase the longitudinal reinforcement when calculating the deflection of the slabs in order to keep the specified deflection?,"It is not possible to automatically increase the reinforcement for the deformation analysis. As soon as the deformation calculation is based on the determination of the stiffness, it is not expedient to develop an algorithm which e.g. B. increases the reinforcement at the point of maximum deformation. Such a procedure would not result in the deformation being reduced.The reinforcement must therefore be increased manually."
I calculate the deformations at time 0 and at time infinity. The deformations at the point of infinity seem plausible to me. The deformations at time 0 appear to be significantly smaller and therefore implausible. What is the reason?,"Please check whether the structure cracks due to pure load. It is possible that the increase in strains is mainly caused by creep and shrinkage, which are not active at time 0. In the non-linear calculation, shrinkage is taken into account as an expansion load, which can cause additional stresses."
I have defined a wind profile for RWIND Simulation up to 100 m altitude.

If your wind tunnel is smaller than the stored profile, only the wind speeds up to this height are taken into account.You can check this visually by displaying the speed vectors and deactivating the display to a reduced area .For a wind tunnel with a height of 50m you will get the following result: Received for a wind tunnel with a height of 150m You get the following result: "

"I can't find any reason why a plastic check is not performed on a Class 1 cross-section. Normally, a check mark must be set for the elastic verification.","In principle, the program always attempts a plastic analysis for cross-section classes 1 and 2. However, if torsion is also included, the verification can only be carried out elastically. This is due to the interaction conditions according to EN 1993-1-1 Section 6.2.9, which do not contain any torsion component.For this reason, the ""Cross-section verifications and torsion"" setting is included in the details of the add-on module. By adapting the limit shear stress for the cross-section verifications, one can also neglect the torsion on one's own responsibility."

"In the direction of internal forces, under the ""Grouped"" selection field, I have four options for smoothing the internal forces. Which group should I choose here?","The internal force determination ""Grouped"" is divided into four subcommands. u with my,mxy,vy,ny,nxyv with mx, mxy,vx,nx,nxyu with mx,mxy,vx,nx,nxyv with my,mxy,vy,ny,n xy The effect of these commands is explained using a simple example. System: Plate as a wall-like supportSpan width 9 mSupport height 1, 5 mPoint load 20 kN in the center of the spanFE mesh size 10 cm. These internal forces are obviously singular results. Detailed information on singularities can be found in the article 001503 . In order to completely enclose at least two FE elements per side of the load introduction by the smoothing area, a smoothing area of 50/50 cm is defined. The following table shows the change in smoothing for each grouping separately. Only the extended upper area of the load introduction is considered. The grouping 0 stands for the unsmoothed internal forces. 01234nx 74.9 kN/m74.9 kN/m 47.2 kN/m 51.8 kN/m74.9 kN/mny109.0 kN/m26.5 kN/m109.0 kN/m109.0 kN/m 5.8 kN/m nxy 75.1 kN/m30.7 kN/m 15 .8 kN/m 30.7 kN/m15.8 kN/m The table shows that a combination of grouping 1 and 2 as well as 3 and 4 always makes sense in relation to the normal forces. The following values are used for the combinations: 1/23/41/2 and 3/4nx47.2 kN/m51.8 kN/m47.1 kN/mny26.5 kN/m 5.8 kN/m 5.3 kN/mnxy12.9 kN/m12.9 kN/m12.9 kN/m As already mentioned, the minimum average internal forces of the respective grouping are used in the combinations 1/2 and 3/4. The shear force nxy is calculated from the forces in the normal direction and is therefore already displayed as a ""smeared shear force"" for the combination 1/2 and 3/4. Summary For a material with pronounced stiffness and strength directions such as reinforced concrete or cross laminated timber, the strength orientation for selecting the correct grouping is relevant. In the combination of group 1/2, the internal forces are smoothed in the longitudinal direction of the component, in group 3/4 in the transverse direction. If the component is oriented in the longitudinal direction smoothing in the longitudinal direction is therefore recommended. However, the type of load introduction and the decisive verification are also important here. All groupings can be used for an isotropic material and for a definitive shear force analysis."
How can I perform the stability analysis for a haunched member?,"Do not simply use the simplified equivalent member method to verify haunched members! For steel construction, the verification can be performed by considering the warping torsion or the general method. These procedures are described in a article. For timber construction, the verification can also be carried out taking into account the warping torsion. The procedure for timber construction becomes fundamental in a webinar explained. According to the equivalent member method, the verification can be carried out if the regulations of the explanations to DIN 1052 Section E8.4.2 (3) for variable cross-sections are observed. This procedure is adopted for Eurocode 5 in various sources of specialist literature. You can find an example of this in a document on brettschichtholz.de from page 64. In the RX-Holz program, the design of haunched members is performed using the equivalent member method. This is briefly presented using a simple example. System : Span width: 8 mSupport height right: 80 cmSupport height left: 26 cmRoof pitch: 3.9° No bracing is defined. The proof of tilting is decisive with 99% at the x-point 1.598m. The cross-sectional height here is 36.8 cm. However, the degree of slenderness is managed with an equivalent cross-section height of 60.9 cm. The equivalent cross-section height results at the x-point 5 .2 m over 0.65 x 8 m = 5.2 m. If a reinforcement e.g. B. occurs in the middle of the span, the substitute height for the x-point changes to 45.3 cm. Because the stiffening is usually ""smeared"" over the bar length "" is applied, the height must be calculated using a special algorithm. The supports are always used as fixed points and the replacement heights are calculated from the x-points of the verification. For the example, this results in: x0, 65= 0.32 x 4 m + 1.598 m = 2.878 m"

How can you consider a hole in the web only near the support? The parameterization only allows centrically arranged holes with the same distance.,"In this case the following options are available:1) Properly split the beam (right click on the beam, Split beam) and set the parameterization so that there is only one central hole in one of the beams. 2) Divide the member into surfaces (right-click on member, Divide member into surfaces), insert a circular opening, define a result member. "
How can I quickly propagate a changed value to the other rows in the input table of an add-in?,"All input tables in the program have so-called block functions in addition to the standard functions. These give the user the option of editing selected numbers and number fields in the table in one step. The block functions can be accessed by right-clicking on the table selection to reach:1. Add - Adds or subtracts a value to cells with a number value.2. Multiply - Cells with a number value are multiplied by a factor.3. Divide - Cells with a number value are divided by a divisor.4. Set - All cells in the selection get the value of the cell selected at the top.5. Generate - For cells with numerical values, the cells between the first and last selected line are generated by interpolating the two edge values. The ""Set"" function can be used in this way quickly transfer a value to other rows. The block functions are great for changing existing node coordinates to a new geometry, linearly extrapolating unit load inputs to a desired value, values to unify and much more."

How is the Cp coefficient surface result determined in RWIND Simulation?,The Cp-coefficient surface result normalizes the determined wind pressures with the dynamic pressure q(H) of the undisturbed inflow at the upper edge of the model. The Cp coefficients or wind pressure coefficients are determined individually at each point on the surface. Positive values here correspond to a pressure load and negative values to a suction load away from the surface. The wind pressure from the undisturbed inflow is determined using the wind profile at the entrance to the wind tunnel at height H. The height H is automatically determined using the highest available model edge.

"Is the load taken into account within the area for ""Nodal support with support""?","The load within this area is not taken into account. Here a homogeneous temperature load (Tc only) has been applied, which leads to stress peaks, although the surface is free to expand.If considering the load is important, the bearing can also be modeled manually. To do this, simply create an opening the size of the column and create a new surface in it according to the surrounding surface. The values for the spring stiffness can be found in the dialog.A surface loaded in this way is then also stress-free under a temperature load"

Point1.X = 2;uCs.Point1.Y = 0;uCs.Point1.Z = 1; uCs.Point2.X = 1;uCs.Point2.Y = 1;uCs.Point2.Z = 2; // set cozy No 2iGuide.PrepareModification();iGuide.SetCoordinateSystem(uCs);iGuide.FinishModification(); // create nodal support with user defined cozyNodalSupport ns = new NodalSupport(); ns.SupportConstantX = -1; ns.SupportConstantY = -1;ns.SupportConstantZ = -1; ns.RestraintConstantX = -1;ns.RestraintConstantY = 0;ns.RestraintConstantZ = -1; ns.Comment = ""user defined cosy "";ns.NodeList = ""1"";ns.ReferenceSystem = ReferenceSystemType.UserDefinedSystemType; ns .UserDefinedReferenceSystem.ObjectNo = 2;ns.UserDefinedReferenceSystem.Type = UserDefinedAxisSystemType.DefinedCoordinateSystemType; iModData.PrepareModification();iModData.SetNodalSupport(ns);iModData.FinishModification(); In order to be able to create the coordinate system, the interface for the helper objects requires: 'IGuideObjects'. With the 'DeleteObjects()' function, an existing coordinate system with the number 2 is first deleted and a new one is created with 'SetCoordinateSystem()'. Note again the 'Prepare/Finish-Modification' block in order to be able to transfer the new element.The nodal support is transferred via the 'IModelData' interface. A 'Prepare/Finish-Modification' block is also required here."

"I would like to model a bolt connection, which can only absorb compressive stresses from the support, using surface releases. Unfortunately, I don't succeed because my model always becomes unstable. Is there a model as a template?","It is best if you create the bolt as a single solid rather than multiple sub-solids (inside the hole). Then you can arrange the surface release between the contact surfaces of the solid bodies. In the case of the bolted connection, the setting for the surface release type would have to be set with a non-linearity in the uz direction Alternatively, releases can also be used and spring stiffness for the other directions.You can download here."
Why do I only get seismic loads calculated in one direction when performing a calculation with RF-/DYNAM Pro?,"Probably too few mode shapes were selected in RF-/DYNAM Pro in the ""Natural Vibration Cases"" mask. It can happen that the defined eigenmodes do not oscillate in all directions and therefore no mass is excited in these directions. You should calculate at least as many eigenmodes that in your calculation the required 90% of the mass is excited in each direction. This is also described in more detail in the FAQ linked below. "
How can I adjust the height and width of a graphic?,"The height and width of a graphic can be adjusted within the ""Graphic printout"" dialog box → ""General settings"" tab → ""Graphic image - size and rotation"". "

The query that then appears as to whether the selected items should be removed from the printout report must be answered with ""Yes"". "
want to examine a long truss top chord for stability. What is the best way to proceed here?,"According to DIN EN 1993-1-1:2010-12 [1] Appendix BB.1.1, the buckling length in the individual bond may be used under certain conditions. This means that not the set of members, but the individual members with the effective length coefficients specified in the standard may be applied.Since this procedure only considers local failure, the complete structure should be examined for global failure independently . For this design, the set of members must have the appropriate imperfection. Under certain conditions, depending on the model, the verification can be carried out on individual members (e.g. mast), or the set of members must be examined for failure from the plane (truss) as in the attached example."
"Even though I deleted the surface load plane, members are still loaded. Why is that?","You have generated member loads with the Member loads from surface load using plane function. You probably only deleted one area load level and not all area load levels.In our example, we defined three individual area load levels. You have then two ways to delete the area load planes. Either you delete the current area load level, or you delete all area load levels. If you only delete the current area load level, then you can still use the other two remaining area load levels in select from the drop-down list. You can tell that all area load planes have been deleted when the Delete all area load planes button is grayed out. "

Why does the deformation of a modeled single-span beam not agree with the manual calculation?,"Presumably, the shear stiffness was not taken into account in the manual calculation or assumed to be infinite. In RFEM/RSTAB, this is taken into account by default according to reality, so that the deformation turns out to be less favorable than in a manual calculation, which only includes the deformation component from bending.Within the global calculation parameters (menu ""Calculation"" → ""Calculation parameters"" ) the shear stiffness can be deactivated. "
"I perform a design in RF-/STEEL AISC for result combinations from RF-/DYNAM Pro and I get the error message ""Undesignable - zero value of the critical moment on the segment"". What should I do?","In this case the only solution is to increase the limit for special cases in bending within the details, for example from 0.01 to 0.05. In this way correspondingly small moments are not taken into account. "
"In RF-STAGES, how can you see the deformation in the current construction stage and that related to the initial system?",The reference system can be changed both in the graphic representation in the project navigator and in the tabular results in the module. Construction stages 2 to 4 are shown on both sides from top to bottom – on the left related to the undeformed system (initial state) and on the right to the respective construction stage.
Is it possible to read out the interactive Geo-Zone-Tool map with load zone entries digitally as an image via a web service?,"Yes, the Geo Zone Tool on the ""Snow Load Zones, Wind Zones and Seismic Zones"" website offers a web service in the background that can be used to create a raster graphic similar to the Geo Zone Tool full screen mode website for a location on the map and load standard without Opening of the website can be generated.The web service can be used for all load cards from the visible online service and is controlled via a URL address. An external process (your application) sends a request URL address to our server (Dlubal) and receives a raster graphic as a result. In order for the process to work, the URL address must contain all the information needed to define the parameters Load Type, Load Norm, Geolocation, Zoom Level, Elevation, Street, ZIP Code, City, State, Image Enable, Image Format, Image Width, Image Height, Output Language and User. It should be noted that this web service function assumes that the address data and the sea level have already been determined via a previous load data web service request for the same geoposition and the modules of the raster image web service request described here are therefore filled with the previously determined data become. The final URL is then composed of these building blocks.The load type and standard are defined using the ""map"" building block. The first part describes the load type (e.g. snow, wind or earthquake) and the second part the standard (e.g. din-en-1991-1-3).→ map= snow-din-en-1991-1-3The geoposition is defined via the ""position"" module.

How do I get the connection forces of a wall-like beam that is rigidly connected to other surfaces?,"In most cases one is interested in a lateral force that results or is smeared across the height and not in the actual course of the surface. There are two tools to read the forces. This is shown below using the example of the shear force. The procedure can also be seen in the video. Evaluation by means of a cut The course can be graphically displayed as a result diagram via a cut. the shear flow nxy is required. This result diagram can then be further evaluated in the course of the results, for example to determine the resulting shear force. In addition, the resultant can also be displayed graphically. In order to ignore the influence of the supports, it is advisable not to create the section directly on the foundation line of the surface. Basically, the following applies: the finer the FE mesh, the more accurate the results. Evaluation using a result bar Another option is to use a result bar, which integrates the surface internal forces and as a member segment size spends If you are only interested in the internal forces, any cross-section can be selected, since a result beam does not bring any additional stiffness into the system. The advantage of the result beam is that the assigned cross-section can also be designed in the add-on modules."

Why does the surface pressure distribution in RFEM differ from the associated surface pressure distribution in RWIND Simulation?,"The RWIND Simulation program places an envelope in the form of a volume mesh around the RFEM model. The wind flow around this envelope results in a discrete surface pressure distribution , which alternates between positive and negative values. In RWIND Simulation, this surface pressure is clearly displayed on the outside of the volume shell.During the transfer to RFEM, the program transforms these pressures on the outside surface of the volume shell back to the RFEM structural model. The surface pressures arounda member are the resultant forces on the FE nodes of the member's center line,a surface as the resultant forces on the FE nodes of the surface's center of gravity andretransforms a volume as resultant forces on the FE nodes of the volume surface. In summary, the internal and external pressures of a component are simplified to net loads for the RFEM calculation.In the case of ""double-sided"" flow onto elements, the surface pressure will always be between RFEM and RWIND simulation. In addition, when interpreting the wind pressures in RFEM, the alignment of the element coordinate systems is important regard. The pressures displayed here do not refer to the sign (positive - pressure and negative - suction) as in RWIND Simulation, but to the local element coordinate system of the respective elements. "
cannot create a new model in the project manager: The button has no function. Where is the problem?,"The project manager is divided into several areas. The project navigator is on the left. In the upper center area, either the models assigned to a project are displayed (""RFEM"", ""RSTAB"" etc. tab) or an overview of the projects appears (""Projects"" tab).When displaying the project overview it is not possible to create a new RFEM or RSTAB model. To do this, switch to the ""RFEM"" or ""RSTAB"" tab. You can find a short guide in the video."
What is a fillet weld used for in SHAPE-THIN?,"A fillet weld is only used to determine weld seam stresses as a result of transverse force Vy, Vz (or Vu, Vv ) and torsional moment Mxp, Mxs. The verification of fillet welds with SHAPE-THIN can be found under the link ""Verification of fillet welds"".A fillet weld does not create a connection between elements. A connection can only be modeled with elements. The modeling of connections can be found under the link ""Connect elements in SHAPE-THIN""."
Is a line hinge between two surfaces sufficient?,"Yes, a line hinge between two surfaces is sufficient. "
"Why doesn't RWIND Simulation converge to the specified minimum pressure difference, but oscillates around a higher limit value?","In fluid mechanics, a distinction is made between laminar and turbulent flows of liquids and gases.A laminar flow is characterized by the fact that no turbulence forms in a transition area between two different flow velocities perpendicular to the flow velocity. In this case, the medium flows in layers around the model and does not mix. On the other hand, a turbulent flow in the flow field appears to vary randomly with a clear mixing of the medium. The Reynolds number, which expresses the ratio of inertial to viscous forces, is used to describe the flow behavior in geometrically similar bodies. While the model geometry and medium properties remain the same, the flow changes from a laminar to a turbulent flow as the flow velocity increases. The laminar flow is characterized by a low Reynolds number and the turbulent flow by a high Reynolds number.The transition from a laminar to a turbulent flow goes through the following basic stages in simple bodies: At low Reynolds numbers, the medium flows around the body in a laminar manner. This behavior occurs at very low speeds or high viscosity. The medium divides in front of the body and merges again behind it. In this case one speaks of a stationary flow. If the Reynolds numbers are slightly higher, one can see that the flow is directly behind the body in flow forms a symmetrical vortex pair. This form of flow is still referred to as stationary. With a further increase in the Reynolds number, a Kármán vortex street forms behind the body in the flow. In this flow pattern, right and left vortices detach from the back of the body with a phase shift. From this point in time, the stationary flow becomes a temporally periodic form of flow. At high Reynolds numbers, the eddies break down into smaller elements and form a turbulent flow boundary layer off. In this area the medium is very turbulent and hardly predictable. At this stage, the medium is no longer moving in a stationary manner. The stationary solution process of RWIND Simulation converges with a pressure difference below the specified minimum value , a stationary flow can usually be assumed (cf. points 1 and 2). If the solution process oscillates around a higher difference value, the program will not find a stable state of the flow. The oscillation is an indication of a periodic vortex shedding (cf. point 3 ). From this point on, the output result is influenced by a time-varying flow and a time-dependent transient calculation is necessary. The RWIND 2 program with the ""Pro"" expansion level provides a corresponding transient solution process for this task."
"am designing a set of members with RF-/STEEL EC3. According to the manual calculation, the proof is fulfilled, but cannot be successfully carried out in the additional module. Why is that?","Please check in the additional module how the support of any intermediate nodes is defined in the masks ""1.4 Intermediate supports"" or ""1.7 Node supports"". Since the module has its own solver, the support conditions from RFEM/RSTAB are not automatically adopted, but must be defined by the user."
"In my system, a U-profile runs flush along a surface. How can I show a welded connection in detail?","The modeling of a contact volume is suitable for a detailed representation. To do this, the U-profile must first be broken down into surfaces (right-click on the member → Break down into surfaces). Then the web surface or the surface of the U-profile to be welded must be projected into the steel surface: Copy nodes and lines into the planeDivide the steel surface using integrated lines (right-click on the Rod → Divide surface using integrated lines)Define zero surfaces as boundary surfaces of the contact solidNow a contact solid can be created between the two surfaces lying on top of each other (click on ""New solid"" → Contact solid → Select boundary surfaces). "
"In my system, a U-profile runs flush along a surface. What is the easiest way for me to simulate a welded connection?","In this case, the simplest solution is to connect the bar and surface using rigid bars at specific intervals. The bar may be in front by right-clicking on the wand and ""Split wand""."

In RF-PUNCH Pro I get the error message that the selected surface edges do not converge to form a corner. What does that mean? How can I fix the error?,"The program is not always able to automatically find the position of a punching node or the nearest edge. In this context, the error message mentioned appears. The problem can be solved by manually setting the border in the respective node. "
How can I delete individual loads by load case?,"As soon as a load is selected, it can be deleted via the context menu or the ""Delete"" button. In general, three options for selecting and deleting are available in RFEM/RSTAB:Graphic Table Data navigator"
How can I change the colors of the rod end joints for the screen or the printout report?,"You can change the color of rod end hinges within the display properties under ""Model data"" → ""Hinges"" → ""Bar end hinges"". "
Can I quickly optimize all cross-sections in my model based on the internal forces?,"No optimization can be derived from the internal forces alone: Whether a cross-section is sufficient or not can only be determined by a calculation according to the relevant standard (via the additional modules).The change to a cross-section can be done from the cross-section and/or stability and/or the SLS verification become necessary. In addition, a cross-section adjustment also changes the stiffness of the overall system or also affects adjacent components (in the case of statically indeterminate systems). As a result, a fully automatic cross-section optimization cannot be carried out from the program.It cannot be set that the cross-section of an element should be changed in such a way that the adjacent components are not overstressed or that an overall optimized structure is found. It is always only possible to optimize the component that is currently being considered. See online manual of RF-/STEEL-EC3 (which performs a member design).In the case of surface components, only the surface thickness can be automatically optimized from the stress analysis."
Can I create a user-defined load or result combination despite automatic load combinatorics?,"Yes. To do this, simply click on the ""New load combination"" or ""New result combination"" button in the ""Load combinations"" or ""Result combinations"" tab and define them as desired."

Is it possible in RFEM to set an axis of symmetry for a symmetrical system so that only half of the system has to be modeled and calculated?,"No, there is no automated option for this.However, there is the option of halving the system and defining appropriate replacement bearings. "
"In my system there are three load cases on the left side, which should act alternatively to each other, and also three load cases on the right side, which should act alternatively among each other. However, the individual load cases should be combined with those on the other side. How can I set these conditions?","First, the automatic combinatorics must be activated within the general data.Then, in the ""Edit load cases and combinations"" dialog, ""Actions"" tab, the ""Different"" effect must be activated, so that the individual load cases in groups can be classified. The assignment is to be made in the ""Group"" column via the list that is accessible by clicking in this column. These set options can then be saved in the register ""Load combinations"" can be checked. "
"When calculating the deformation in RF-CONCRETE Members, I get jumps in the deformation curve. Why is that?","In RF-CONCRETE Members, the deformation in the cracked state is determined using a coefficient ""ζ"" (according to EN 1992-1-1 7.4.3). With this simplified procedure, the coefficient ζ per member is determined only once and the linear deformation is scaled up according to the governing point in the member. In this context, it is it is possible that a different ζ is determined for each member. In the course of scaling the linear deformation, there are then jumps between individual members. To avoid this effect, we recommend using sets of members. "
How can you select objects via the COM interface?,"The ""SelectObjects"" function is available in the IModelData interface (or IModeldata2 and similar) for selecting objects. The function expects the object type and the object number(s) as a character string. Here is a short example:Sub select_objects() Dim model As RFEM5.modelSet model = GetObject(, ""RFEM5.Model"")model.GetApplication.LockLicense On Error GoTo e Dim iModdata As IModelData2 Set iModdata = model.GetModelData ' enable Selections iModdata.EnableSelections True ' select nodes 2-3 and lines 1 and 3 iModdata.SelectObjects ModelObjectType.NodeObject, ""2-3"" iModdata.SelectObjects ModelObjectType.LineObject, ""1,3"" ' deselect nodes and lines iModdata.SelectObjects ModelObjectType.NodeObject, """" iModdata.SelectObjects ModelObjectType.LineObject, """" e: If Err.Number <> 0 Then MsgBox Err.description, , Err.Source model.GetApplication.UnlockLicenseSet iModdata = NothingSet model = Nothing End Sub Im In the upper part, the selections are activated and then nodes 2 to 3 and lines 1 and 3 are selected. Then the lines and nodes are deselected again with an empty character string.If you want to read or modify selected objects, you need the ""IModelData.EnableSelections"" function (also found in the code above). If the function is called with ""True"", only the selected nodes are then read, for example with the ""IModelData.GetNodes()"" function."
"How can I set it to display all local extrema of the member sizes in my system, not just an extremum of the overall model?","To display all local extreme values, deactivate the ""Extreme values"" option in the Show navigator under ""Results"" → ""Members"". "
How can I see the shear stresses on zero elements in SHAPE-THIN?,"Since zero elements (t=0, t* > 0) have no influence on the moments of inertia or section modulus, but are required for the shear area calculation, for example, the shear stresses can also be calculated on these elements.The display or calculation of the stresses on zero elements can be activated in the calculation parameters. You can choose whether the voltages are redistributed to the connected elements or displayed directly."
"Which cross-sections can I design with the add-on module ""RF-/STEEL Cold-Formed Sections""?","With the add-on module ""RF-/STEEL cold-formed sections"" cold-formed L, Z, C, U, hat and CL sections can be designed from the cross-section database. In addition, general cold-formed (non-perforated) SHAPE-THIN 9 cross-sections can also be detected. "
Can you couple members with solid elements?,"A 1D element (bar) cannot be directly integrated into the 3D elements of the volume. However, there are tools that enable coupling.If a slender component (bar) is to be connected to a solid component (solid body), care must be taken to ensure the correct coupling of these elements during modeling. p>1. If, for example, a support with a front plate is screwed rigidly to a single foundation, this can be implemented using a ""connecting cross"". The problematic rotational degrees of freedom can thus be transferred via translational degrees of freedom. The dimensions of the ""connection cross"" should roughly correspond to the cross-section dimensions. 2. If, for example, a bar is concreted into a single foundation, this should volume can be divided in the plane of the rod so that the connection between the rod and the boundary surface and thus also with the volume is guaranteed. "
How can I subsequently print an image of my model without loads and without reference to a load case in the printout report?,"In order for the image to be printed without loads and without reference to a load case, all results and loads must be hidden.

"When I check the steel stress in RF-CONCRETE surfaces, I get the error message 108. Why is that?","The error message 108) appears if the stress analysis cannot be performed because the design situation preset for the analysis has not been defined. By default, RF -CONCRETE surfaces for the stress analysis of the reinforcing steel a load or a load case from the ""characteristic design situation"". If this has not been defined, the verification will not be carried out and a corresponding error message will be issued. To fix this, please select ""1.1 General information "" select a ""characteristic load"" in the ""Serviceability"" tab. See video.Alternatively, you can also change the detailed settings for the serviceability limit state analysis so that the stress analysis, e.g. B. is carried out with a quasi-permanent load. However, this change to the standard setting or standard specifications is at the discretion of the user. "
don't get any deformations in the results of the calculation with RF-CONCRETE Surfaces. What can be the reason?,"First check whether ""Deformation calculation"" has been activated in the settings for the calculation of the SLS checks. Also check whether in A load for the ""quasi-permanent"" design situation was specified in the ""Serviceability Limit State"" tab of window 1.1. By default, a quasi-permanent load is required for the calculation of deformations in RF-CONCRETE surfaces (with RF-CONCRETE Deflect or RF-CONCRETE NL). "
"What do the ""overlapping surfaces"" mean in RF-PUNCH Pro? Do I have to set something here?","The ""overarching surfaces"" (column I in table 1.5) are more of an informative character.Theoretically, you can select or deselect the surfaces that are to be taken into account in the punching analysis and could thus use the If necessary, shorten the critical perimeter (see video).But you usually don't have to make any changes there."
How can a wooden panel wall be modeled with RFEM?,"For modeling the uprights, foot ribs, head ribs, etc., rods can be used on wooden panels that are planked on one side. If the wooden panel is planked on both sides, it is advisable to replace the rods with surfaces. The uprights are connected to the top and bottom ribs in an articulated manner. The planking can then be defined.In the case of wooden surfaces, it is important to ensure that an orthotropic material model is used.When defining the support, the user can decide whether this is linear or non-linear are to be carried out.The flexibility of the connection of planking to the bars can be done by means of line releases. The springs refer to a length of 1 meter (kN/m/m = kN/m²), which is why the displacement modulus of a lanyard must be multiplied by the number of lanyards per running meter.In the accompanying video you can see the see the exact procedure. First the results are shown and then the modelling."
have two solids that are adjacent but not coincident. What should be considered when modelling?,"Two solids that are adjacent to each other share the common boundary surface at the points of contact. Away from this, i.e. where no other solid is adjacent, the boundary lines of the other adjoining surfaces are defined. When modeling, the side surface is the larger one to split the solid if necessary."
Why does a fully bedded surface become unstable after it has been split and given a line hinge?,"Since the surface support is linked to the surface number within the program, a new surface without bedding has been created here. So another one has to be added here are assigned to area supports. "
Why is a node that I have selected not displayed?,"If all other nodes are shown, visibility mode is probably on. Deactivate this via the toolbar or the menu bar. "
At the edge of a surface there is an opening into which a rigid surface is to be inserted. I get an error message about opening. What should I do?,"In this case, no opening is necessary at all, so it can simply be deleted. If necessary, the boundary lines of the area must be redefined."
The rectangular loads are not displayed correctly. Do I need to adjust something?,"There are probably small inconsistencies in the modeling in your model, so that the node coordinates deviate from the coordinates of the free rectangular loads and the loads are therefore not displayed correctly. Please check your model and make the appropriate corrections. The loads should then appear as expected. "
"Can RF-/FOUNDATION Pro also be used to check the crack width limitation according to EN 1992-1-1, Section 7.3?","No, RF-/FOUNDATION Pro does not carry out a crack width limitation analysis.If a larger foundation slab is to be designed, where the crack width limitation may be required for constraint from the outflow of hydration heat, this can be done slab can be designed with RF-CONCRETE Surfaces. The crack width limitation check is available in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces."
"have modeled a line hinge, which I cannot see on the corresponding line.","If a line joint is not visible, although the corresponding line can be seen, the line joints are probably switched to inactive in the display navigator. They can be reactivated accordingly there. "
Does RFEM recognize that a member is connected to a surface despite eccentricity?,"Yes, as long as there are common nodes and the line of the member represents a boundary line of the surface or is integrated into the surface. "
How can I switch the display of the support forces from local to global for a rotated nodal support?,The global or local display of support reactions can be set using the results navigator.

How can I quickly find all bars that are parallel to each other?,"Bars lying parallel to one another can be selected most effectively using the ""Select special"" function. Then, if necessary, visibility can be increased using selected objects are activated."
Are the loads in the table of crane loads in mask 1.4 to be entered for a crane per axle or per wheel?,All crane loads always refer to the respective axis of the crane. The entered loads are then automatically distributed in the program to the number of wheels per axle. You can also check the applied loads very quickly and conveniently using 3D rendering.
"When determining the internal forces in RFEM, I get normal compressive forces that do not appear in the design internal forces in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces. Why is that, what is the background?","In the case of components that are predominantly subjected to compression, the preset optimization of the design internal forces can lead to the compressive axial force being assigned to the stiffening concrete strut. In such cases it is closed recommend disabling the optimization of the design internal forces and not applying any optimization of the design internal forces. With this setting, the internal forces are not optimized and the compressive force appears in the design internal forces . In the example shown, however, the compressive force is absorbed by the concrete in both situations. "
How can you create visibilities via the COM interface?,"Visibility can be created using the RF-COM 3 /RS-COM 6 interfaces, the IrfView interface is used for this.

Then the visibility of these elements is created and gets the name ""view"". The ""view"" visibility is in the ""test"" group. The creation is done with the separator ""|"". After the visibility has been created, it is still selected or displayed, PVM_SHOW is of the type ""RF_PARTIAL_VIEW_MODE"" which e.g. B. can also remove the visibility. The function can also determine whether the elements are displayed in the background."
How can a member load be applied graphically to several members?,"To apply a member load (graphically), first open the ""New member load"" dialog via the menu Insert → Loads → 3.2 Member loads → Graphically or the corresponding icon in the toolbar. The load parameters must then be defined. After clicking on ""OK"", the member load can be applied by clicking on the respective member. Alternatively, it is possible to apply member loads to multiple members in a single step. To do this, hold down the left mouse button and open a window over the relevant members. If the window is drawn from left to right, a load is applied to the bars that lie entirely in this area. Dragging the window from right to left also applies the load to the bars that are only partially in this area. It is also useful to work with visibilities or views. It is also possible to first select the members to which the member load is applied and then to open the ""New member load"" dialog. After defining the member load parameters and clicking ""OK"", the member load is applied to the previously selected members.The video first shows in load case 1 how a member load is applied by clicking on the respective members one after the other. In load case 2, the load is applied in one step by opening a window over the relevant members. In load case 3, the members to be loaded are first selected. After defining the member load parameters, the member load is applied to the previously selected members."
Can a shear force reduction at the support or a design with the shear force at a distance d to the support also be carried out in RF-CONCRETE surfaces?,"No, the function known from RF-CONCRETE Members regarding the shear force reduction does not exist in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces. RF-CONCRETE Surfaces always performs the check in the respective FE mesh nodes or grid points."
How can I change the FE mesh settings via the COM interface?,"The general FE mesh settings can be modified using the IFeMeshSettings interface. This interface is under IModel > IModelData > ICalculation localized. Here is another code example in which the desired length of the FE elements is set to 100mm.

"If I carry out the ""Manual definition of reinforcement areas"" in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces, do I have to reinforce the entire component completely myself? Or does RF-CONCRETE surfaces apply the required reinforcement in the areas in which I have not carried out a manual definition?","The determination of the statically required reinforcement (ULS) is initially independent of the manual specification of reinforcement areas.However, if you want to carry out the verification in the serviceability limit state, you must use all surfaces that are defined in RF -CONCRETE surfaces were selected for the check, manually apply reinforcement. If this is not done, RF-CONCRETE places surfaces for the SLS check at the Don't put on reinforcement. The statically required reinforcement is not taken over here. In this case (for the non-reinforced areas) you get the message in the results mask 3.x that the reinforcement was not sufficiently defined. No checks are calculated for these areas. "
"In my model there is a member that is only subjected to tension but must not be defined as a tension member, otherwise the model will become unstable.

How can I draw a line perpendicular from a given node to the next line?,"The ""Rotate"" and ""Extend line"" functions are suitable for this:rotate a line adjacent to the corresponding node by 90 degrees (context menu: rotate) Extend the new line from the start/end of a member to the next line using the ""Extend line"" function (context menu) "
How can I display the results of an add-on module in the graphic in RSTAB or RFEM?,"The results of most add-ins can be easily viewed in the main program's graph. There are two ways to do this:Displaying the results directly from the add-on module: In most add-on modules you will find the ""Graphic"" button in the lower area after the calculation. If you choose this, the module closes and the results are displayed directly in the graphic of the main program.Displaying the results from the main program: You have the option of selecting the desired module case via the toolbar. Depending on whether you select the results of a load case or a module case, there are different results to choose from in the navigator."
How can the size of the graphic in the short printout be adjusted?,The graphic is printed at the same scale as the display scale on the monitor. The print dialog does not offer any other setting options (Illus. 1). The graphics on the screen must therefore be adjusted accordingly.

"When designing in RAHMECK Pro, I get error 30011 ""The selected nodes differ in geometry [...]"". How can I prove my connection?","Check the cross-sections of your frame corner or connection.The program checks whether the assignment of the members for the calculation is permissible. If this is not the case, a footnote is issued, which is explained in the ""Note"" column.

How can a profile be placed on another profile?,"The offset point of the profile serves as a reference point to place the profile in the cross section. This point is highlighted in red in the profile sketch of the ""Set profile"" dialog. The y and z coordinates refer to the profile centroid. By clicking on one of the red nodes or turquoise gripping points, another reference point can be specified. At this point, the profile is ""glued"" to the mouse pointer before it is finally set with a mouse click.The clever choice of the profile offset point makes it easier to set the profile on elements. This is also shown in the video. It should be noted that the profiles shown in the video are not yet connected to each other. How these can be connected is shown in FAQ 002389 ."
How can I model a coupling of superimposed surfaces that only touch in one line?,"When two surfaces are on top of each other, a contact solid can usually be used (see ""Links"" below). If the contact only takes place in one line, the coupling could be realized with a surface. The problem here is that a surface in two dimensions needs FE elements, so using members is more convenient. Furthermore, no line approval is required for additional storage conditions. In the example, rigid members with corresponding member end hinges are used. Here there is a pull failure and no moments are passed. It becomes clear that the deformation of the right surface in the line corresponds to the left surface at every point ."
How can I apply an oblique point load to a member without splitting the member?,"You can create a node that does not split the member with the function ""Set node 'On line'"" in the member context menu. With With this node type, a line is not split into two lines, but left as a whole line. The node parameter δ describes the relative distance to the starting node of the line. Nodes on lines make it possible to place nodal loads anywhere on the line or to force an FE node.You can then apply a nodal load to these nodes at any angle as usual. As you can check in the results, the force works as expected. "
Can a line grid be saved as a pattern and reused?,"A line grid can be saved as a pattern and reused. To save a line grid, click the ""Save"" button. In the ""Save data of dialog box"" dialog, enter a name for the line grid. Clicking on ""OK"" saves the line grid as a pattern.

The copying is then carried out using Drag & Drop introduced."
"After importing a file, some nodes do not line up exactly. Is there a way to unify the coordinates?","The quickest way is to edit the coordinates of multiple nodes at the same time. To do this, proceed as follows: Select all affected nodes (by opening a window or by selecting with the Ctrl key) and edit them (e.g. by double-clicking one of the selected nodes). The ""Edit node"" window opens. Those coordinates which are already uniform are given as a value. No value is displayed in the directions where values differ. Here you have the option of adjusting the coordinates for all nodes at the same time. In the example shown, you would enter the desired value for the Y coordinate in order to move the nodes onto the line. The procedure is shown in the attached video. If the line is then to be divided by the nodes, the ""Connect lines/members"" function can be used. This divides the line into nodes and creates several new lines."
Can the coordinates of a line grid be imported from Excel?,"The values can be read from Excel into the line grid by copying (Ctrl + C) and inserting (Ctrl + V).First, copy the desired values in Excel using Ctrl + C. Then click in the target area of the table of the line grid. The values can then be pasted using Ctrl + V. The query ""Replace data"" has to be answered with ""All"". The video shows how the coordinates of a line grid are imported from Excel can become. Furthermore, the addition of an additional line grid coordinate is presented."
"When checking in RF-/DYNAM Pro, I get the message ""No natural vibration case or dynamic load case was selected for the calculation"". How is this to be understood?","This message appears when all defined natural vibration cases or dynamic load cases have already been calculated. Because the check only checks the input data that has not yet been calculated.You can say that the check is only to be used before the calculation: If there are input errors, the calculation cannot be carried out anyway. p>"
"If I create a user-defined result value, the RFEM solver window opens briefly and the calculation appears to be repeated. Where does it come from? I've done the calculation before.","If you have performed a calculation in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces, then results at FE mesh nodes and at grid points are available.If you store a user-defined result value in a surface, then a interpolated value from the existing values from the calculation in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces is displayed at the FE mesh nodes. This interpolated value is displayed while dropping the custom result value (while the mouse cursor is hovering over the area).When the command to drop a custom result value is completed (ESC key), then RF calculates -CONCRETE surfaces this actual value again at this point. This briefly displays the solver window. Depending on how complex the calculation is, this solver window is only displayed for a very short time or for several seconds.Due to the initial display of interpolated values and the subsequent calculation of the actual result value, there may be small differences here come."

"When defining friction, there are two interaction relationships. How do these differ? When defining the same coefficients of friction, shouldn't the result be identical?","The forces are defined in the corresponding dialog. The maximum frictional force depends on the load in the Y-direction or Z-direction. Depending on which interaction formula is used, different frictional forces result.ExampleA support is to transfer the force in the global X-direction via friction. The coefficient of friction is 0.1 for all directions. The support force PY is 5 kN and the support force PZ 10 kN.This results in the non-linearity ""Friction PY ' PZ'..."" the following maximum support force in the X direction:${\mathrm P}_{\mathrm X,\max}\;=\;{\mathrm\ mu}_{\mathrm X}\;\cdot\;\sqrt{\;{\mathrm P}_{\mathrm Y}^2\;+\;{\mathrm P}_{\mathrm Z}^2 }\\{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X,\max}\;=\;0.1\;\cdot\;\sqrt{\;5^2\;+\;10^2}\; =\;1.118\;\mathrm{kN}$For the second option ""Friction PY' + PZ'...""results in the maximum bearing force:${\mathrm P}_{\mathrm X,\max}\;=\ ;{\mathrm \mu }_{\mathrm {XY}}\;\cdot\;\left|{\mathrm P}_{\mathrm Y}\right|\;+\;{\mathrm \mu }_ {\mathrm{XZ}}\;\cdot\;\left|{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Z}}\right|\\{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrmX,\max}\;=\ ;0.1\;\cdot\;5\;+\;0.1\;\cdot\;10\;=\;1.500\;\mathrm{kN}$While at the With the first option, the resulting support force is used to determine the frictional force, with the second option, the forces are added linearly.Thus, with the first option, the system becomes unstable from a force >1.118 kN, with the second option only from >1,500 kN."
How can I define a slip between two surfaces?,"A slip between two surfaces can be created using a line release. The line release must have the ""Diagram"" type and a stop in the direction of the slip after the slip (here 3 mm).The result shows how the left surface only ""supports"" the right surface after a deformation of 3 mm."
"I get the error ""The stiffness matrix is singular"" when doing the calculation with RF FORM-FINDING. What can I do?","In principle, the calculation with RF-FORM-FINDING has the same requirements as a calculation without this module, so the criteria for general instabilities should be checked (see ""Links"").However, it happens more often Problems with RF FORM-FINDING because the form-finding process was activated for too many elements. It should therefore be checked whether the correct (necessary) elements have been activated. form-finding has been activated as an example for all horizontal members. The result is that the error ""The stiffness matrix is singular"" is output. If the beam bars are now deactivated, the calculation is successful."
Is it possible to model cold-formed sections with SHAPE-THIN 8 and design them in RF-/STEEL Cold-formed Sections?,Cross-sections created with SHAPE-THIN 8 cannot be analyzed in RF-/STEEL Cold-formed Sections according to EN 1993-1-3 and EN 1993-1-5.A design of cold-formed sections modeled with SHAPE-THIN 9 is possible in RF-/STEEL Cold-Formed Sections.

Is it possible to measure the crane runway girder in KRANBAHN without stiffeners on the bearings?,"The shear resistance of the web is verified during the design. If there are no stiffeners in the area of the supports, a minimum wheel spacing according to EN 1993-1-5 Chapter 5.3(2)(a) must be observed for the start and end supports. The program provides two solution approaches here. a) A stiffener is arranged for the start and end support b) Buffers are arranged in window 1.4, which guarantee the minimum distance between the crane wheel and the support."

However, it can also be exported separately.You can find further examples on our homepage in the Downloads → Models to download (see link below this FAQ)."
How are the sign conventions for internal forces defined?,"The sign convention depends on the orientation of the local z-axis. How this is aligned can be defined in the basic data. If the global z-axis is aligned downwards, the local z-axis is also automatically aligned downwards oriented. There is no way to orient them upwards. If the global z-axis is still aligned up, the user has the choice to align the local z-axis up or down. If the local z-axis Axis oriented down in general information, the following applies:The bending moment My is positive if at the Tensilestresses arise on the positive member side (in the direction of the z-axis). Mz is positive if compressivestresses occur on the positive member side (in the direction of the y-axis). The sign definition for torsional moments, normal and shear forces corresponds to the usual conventions: These internal forces are positive if they act in a positive direction on the positive cutting edge.Is the local z-axis in the general data according to up aligned, the following applies:The bending moment My is positive when on the positive bar side (in Direction of the axis z) compressivestresses arise. Mz is positive if there are tensilestresses on the positive side of the member (in the direction of the y axis). The sign definition for torsional moments and normal forces corresponds to the usual conventions. These internal forces are positive if they act in a positive direction on the positive shear edge. The shear forces are positive if they act in the negative direction on the positive cutting edge."
Can I also design a solid construction in RFEM according to ÖNORM?,"The Eurocode 2 with the national appendix for Austria is available in the additional modules for solid construction.As soon as a license for ""EC2 for RFEM"" is available, the Eurocode can be used with all available NA's are used.The National Annex for Austria is available in the following modules for reinforced concrete construction: RF-CONCRETE Surfaces RF-CONCRETE MembersRF-CONCRETE ColumnsRF-STANZ ProRF-FUND ProIn itself This also applies to the RSTAB add-on modules that deal with reinforced concrete construction."
Can the resilience of the fasteners in the RF-/JOINTS Timber - Steel to Timber module also be taken into account automatically when determining the internal forces?,"Yes, that is possible - but only in RFEM. Unfortunately, this function does not exist in RSTAB.In order to use the export of the stiffnesses, the options must be activated in the details. This means that the stiffnesses are exported to RFEM before the calculation and the internal forces are calculated taking the flexible connections into account. However, no additional static model is created, but the existing model is modified.When starting the RF-JOINTS calculation, the eccentricity and connection are transferred to RFEM as member properties and node releases are also created in RFEM. This information can be found in the RFEM tables ""1.14 Member Hinges"", ""1.15 Member Eccentricities"", ""1.24 Node Releases"" and ""1.30 Connections"". The internal forces for the verifications are then determined with the modified model.Export options exist for all members for which eccentricities and releases can be defined. If there are already members with hinges or truss members in the model, the additional connection hinges would lead to instabilities in the calculation. A corresponding message therefore appears before the dialog is closed.In the downloads at the end of this FAQ you will find an example in which the stiffness export is only shown for the eaves node. If you want to take the flexibility of the fasteners into account, you should always define all connections."

"I have a flat surface with a line running through it. Why is the ""Split area using integrated lines"" function grayed out?","Please check the integrated lines or the automatic object recognition within the ""Edit area"" dialog window, ""Integrated"" tab. In some cases the automatic object recognition was deactivated in the course of model editing. Therefore, make sure that the corresponding lines are integrated into the area."
"I get the message that the general procedure is only valid for I-profiles, although I want to design an I-profile. How come?","So that a profile can be recognized as an I-profile in RF-/STEEL EC3, the cross-section type I-profile must be stored. This is the case for the rolled and welded I-profiles from the cross-section library; this assignment is no longer available for assembled or modified cross-sections. Therefore, for example, it can no longer be automatically recognized as an I-profile in the case of ICM profiles (modified I-profiles). The easiest way to create the profile nonetheless to measure with the General Procedure is a change of attitudes. The design can also be released for other profiles with the option 'Also allow for non-I profiles'."
Can I take the normal force into account when designing a rigid end plate connection according to the DSTV ring binder?,"Originally, the typified moment-bearing connections of the DSTV ring binder were not designed for the stress of a normal force. However, a load of up to 5% of the plastic normal force carrying capacity of the connected beam may be neglected in accordance with the information given in the ring binder. If the beam contains a higher axial force, a warning message is also issued in RF-/JOINTS Steel - DSTV. With the additional volume of the ring binder from 2018, additional moment-bearing connections with the designation IM included. In the variant as a beam-to-beam connection, these are also designed to absorb normal force stress. If you design such a connection, instead of the warning message, a verification of the axial resistance including MN interaction appears. For beam-column connections, the axial resistance is the However, support components are not included in the table values according to the DSTV ring binder. Therefore, the connection must be proven again separately. Consequently, the warning message still appears here. As an alternative, you can use RF-/JOINTS Steel - Rigid."
"For a specific combination rule, I want to consider a load case with a non-standard combination factor. How can I do it?","First you should consider whether it might not be easier for the deviating combination rule to define the load combinations manually in addition to the automatically generated combinations: If there are only a few load combinations, these can be created quickly. However, if the effort is too great due to many load cases, you can proceed as follows:ExampleFor the combination rule ""Earthquake"" according to EN 1990, the snow (≤ 1000 m) can be taken into account with 0.5 instead of ψ2 = 0.0. However, according to the standard, ψ2 should be taken into account with 0.0 for the ""permanent/temporary"" design situation.In order to take into account different values for the two combination rules, the load case Snow can be copied and the action category of the copied load case changed to ""Other"". By default, the combination coefficient ψ2 stored with 0.5. If you need a different value, you can use a different one , select the appropriate action combination for the copied load case. If no action category meets the desired value, a user-defined standard can be created. You can find out how to create one in the link below this FAQ.To ensure that load cases 3 and 4  do not overlap, the respective load case must be excluded in the combination rules. This is done using the ""Reduce number of load cases..."" function. The load cases can then be assigned to the respective combination rules are to be combined with each other. You now get the desired load combinations."
"When modeling a wall, lifting forces arise in the support area that we cannot explain. As soon as the wall is not modeled and the floor is supported directly, we get plausible support forces. Where is the mistake?","You can easily use the deformations here to evaluate the results. Since the deformations are very small, increase the number of decimal places for the display of the deformation in the first step.If you display the deformation in global Y for the pillar and increase the display factor, you can clearly see how the wall is bent. The support reaction counteracts this deformation as a restraint. If you define a line support directly at the edge of the slab, the flexibility of the wall panel does not apply."
"I have the following problem when programming in VBA with RFEM lines: ""No assignment to data field possible"". What can I do?","There is an error in Excel VBA which we cannot correct.

Why?","Please check in the entered model whether there was no unit error when entering the width t of the ""Wall in Z"". The input must be made in ""mm"" at this point in the program.If the width t is specified in cm instead of mm, RF-PUNCH Pro does not recognize the end of the wall or the wall corner.As soon as the input has been corrected, the node can also be selected again in RF-PUNCH Pro for verification."
How can a nodal support be aligned perpendicular to a line?,"Each nodal support has a local axis system X', Y' and Z'. By default, it is aligned parallel to the global X, Y, and Z axes. The local axis system of the support can be rotated with the ""User-defined axis system"" option. If the nodal support is to be aligned perpendicular to a line, do so the option ""Identical to the line"" is recommended. The ""Identical to line"" option is only available for straight lines. The local axis system of the bearing is aligned parallel to the local axis system of the line. The local axis system of the line can be displayed in the project navigator - Show via Model → Lines → Line axis systems x,y,z. The axis system of the line can be influenced via the line direction and line rotation. To change the direction of the line, right-click on the line and then select ""Reverse Line Orientation"" from the context menu. Line rotation can be set in the ""Rotation"" tab of the ""Edit line"" dialog. Alternatively, the axis system of the nodal support can be aligned perpendicular to the line using a user-defined coordinate system or by specifying three nodes .The three options are shown in the video. An auxiliary straight line is generated perpendicular to the line to align the bearing axis system using a user-defined coordinate system or specifying three points. This makes it easy to align an axis perpendicular to the line. "
Which glulam beam types can be calculated with a raised dry joint?,"A loose ridge wedge can be taken into account for beam types 5 and 6, i.e. only for types with a curved bottom chord. This function does not exist for beam type 3 with a straight bottom chord."
How to create intersecting surfaces/solids without keeping the associated intersection?,"There is an option that an intersection can be converted to a line. This option allows you to create the penetration manually. Here is a small example to illustrate:1. First, an intersection is created between two objects, here using the ""New Composite Volume"" command: In this specific case, the cylinder is subtracted from the cuboid, resulting in a penetration: 2. This intersection is now ""converted to lines"". To do this, all objects involved are selected and ""Convert to line"" is selected in the context menu in the sub-item ""Intersection"": 3. The new lines are used, to create new areas or modify existing ones. This can be modified by reselecting the boundary lines of an area. The penetration surface in particular must be modeled as a quadrangle surface: 4. Finally, the volume must be recreated: "

When using a line release I get an error message that the system is unstable. What is the reason?,"A system in which surfaces 1 and 2 are to rest on bars 1 and 2. The members 1 and 2 should be supported by the nodal supports 1 and 2. The line release is required to decouple the members from the surfaces. type defined. The displacement uz is only affected by a tensile force, the other displacements ux, uy and the torsion φx are always released. Line release 1 is defined at line 5 and releases bar 1. Line release 2 is defined at line 14 and releases bar 2. Bar 1 is now defined on line 15 generated by the line release with nodes 12 and 13 and member 2 on line 16 generated by the line release with nodes 14 and 15. The members 1 and 2 have different nodes (13 and 14) at their point of intersection and are not connected to them. Furthermore, the nodal supports 1 and 2 are on The nodes 5 and 10 are defined and the surfaces do not support the members. During a calculation, since the bars are not supported. The connection between bars 1 and 2 can be established by using node 13 generated by line release 1 in line release 2 is defined as a definition node. Bars 1 and 2 then share the same node 13 and are connected to it. Furthermore, nodal supports 1 and 2 are at the nodes of bars 1 and 2. "
"Why do I get large differences in results, both in deformation and bending moments, when applying skewness by imperfection to a single member and a multi-part set of members with the same overall length?","Imperfections are taken into account for the calculation with equivalent member loads. The force applied transversely to the longitudinal direction of the member results from multiplying the normal force by the angle. In the case of a changing normal force profile, the average per member is used. Especially in the case of stress from an increasing normal force (e.g. from the self-weight) there can be large differences, since the applied force has a significantly longer lever arm in the case of a single member.If a vertical nodal load in combination with the imperfection is applied only to the column head, are the results of a member and those of the set of members are identical.The following is a simple example with one member and a set of members made up of four individual members with a total length of 8.00 m.The calculation is not aborted due to instability (through the iterative determination of the normal force to be applied), the absolute misalignment in LC2 is 200 mm and a linearly variable load (to further increase the effect) in LC1 of 2.5 kN/m 0.00 kN/m is assumed.The imperfection load to be applied is read off for every 2.00 m using the ""Result curves in the member"" dialog window and the area-by-area, linear smoothing option and applied as a vertical load with changing signs. The horizontal loads result from multiplying the vertical load by (200 mm / 8000 mm).These equivalent loads were then applied to the members as nodal loads in LC4 and compared with the results of LK1.The very small differences in results result from rounding errors and the calculation according to Th. II. O."
would like to have the resulting wind load determined for each floor of a building. What is the easiest way to do this?,"The quickest way to do this is with a results bar. For the sake of simplicity, this can be placed directly next to the building. The function of the result member is to convert all member, surface and volume internal forces into a beam element in order to to obtain the internal forces for the entire structure related to a member. With the result bar, it is possible to read the resulting shear force for each floor in the X and Y direction.After defining the result bar, the integrated internal forces of the result bar can be viewed. The internal forces Vz and Vy are important for the evaluation here. The maximum shear force is visible on the bottom of the result element, which takes the whole structure into account. The shear force for each floor is always given by the difference between the upper and lower value determined. Care must be taken to use a sufficiently fine division of the result member (Calculation parameters → Global calculation parameters → Number of member divisions for - result diagrams) and to define a sufficiently fine FE mesh, as this can sometimes have a strong influence on the accuracy of the results."

Can I use RFEM/RSTAB to design laminated veneer lumber LVL?,"The dimensioning of laminated veneer lumber LVL is carried out with the additional modules for wood dimensioning.The following steps are necessary for the dimensioning:Select material of the category laminated veneer lumber - if If the desired manufacturer is not in the material database, a user-defined material can be created (see FAQ 002656). With the choice of material, the user determines the stress on the material. In the case of LVL, plate loading results in significantly different load-carrying capacities than disk loading. If a design is to be carried out with the RF-/TIMBER Pro module, there will usually be a disk load. The RF-LAMINATE module is often useful for plate loading.In the RF-/TIMBER Pro design module, the ""Coefficient category"" for LVL is used in window 1.2. In the parameters of the national appendix, adjustments may have to be made in the two tabs ""Other settings"" for the dimensioning of LVL. This concerns e.g. the shear or manufacturer specifications for increasing the strength. The cross-section of the LVL material is usually not strong enough for stress in the plane of the panel. However, if the planking of a ceiling is to be verified, this can be done with the RF-LAMINATE module. Further information on RF-LAMINATES can be found here."
signed up for an online training course. Do I need my dongle for this?,"In online training courses, the communication between the lecturer and the course participant takes place live over the Internet. During the training, each participant can ask questions at any time via chat.You need a reliable and fast internet connection (e.g. DSL) and a headset.A dongle and thus access You only need your license if you want to do the modeling on your computer at the same time as the online training. In this case, working with two monitors is recommended so that you can see your program interface and the video at the same time.If the training is not basic, basic knowledge of the use of RSTAB or RFEM is required.

How can I model a manhole whose lid has a variable thickness?,"This task can be easily solved with RFEM:In the first step, create your structure with surfaces of constant thickness.Now double-click on the surface to which you want to assign a variable thickness.In the ""Thickness"" dialog section, select the ""Variable..."" option and then press the [Edit] button.In the "" dialog"" New linearly variable thickness"" define the variable thickness over three edge nodes of the surface."
How to gradually apply the load of a load case to the model?,"In the calculation parameters of the programs RFEM or RSTAB, there are the input fields ""Number of load steps for load cases/load combinations"" under the ""Global calculation parameters"" tab. These two inputs control the numerical incremental application of the defined load boundary conditions in the respective load cases and load combinations. The reciprocal value of the input describes a fraction of the load. The solution process then successively applies the defined load fractions to the model in so-called load stages until the full load is reached. In the respective load levels, the equation solver tries to find a balance within the framework of the maximum permitted iterations and thus to specify suitable starting values for the next load level. You can Imagine that the solution process collects the complete load of a load case or a load combination in a ""watering can"" and pours it in portions onto the load-collecting model. The number of load levels correlates with the speed of application. The speed is not to be understood as a real time parameter, but purely numerical. The gradual load application only has an effect on non-linear load-bearing systems. As a rule, it delivers a correspondingly higher quality of results with an increasing number of load steps. The basic goal of this method is to find a micro-convergence in the respective load levels to specify new high-quality starting values for the next load level and thus finally to achieve a macro-convergence for the entire load case. "
How can I enter or read out a response spectrum via the COM interface in DYNAM Pro?,"Using the COM interface, a user-defined response spectrum can be read out or created in both RSTAB and RFEM.For the conversion, the interface to the module must first be fetched via the interface to the RFEM model (IModel). (IDynam module). This interface is then used to create the module case (IModuleCase). IModuleCase contains the GetRSParams function, which can be used to initially read out the parameters for the response spectrum. The SetRSParams function as an opponent can write the new data. The following is an example code for clarification:Dim iApp As RFEM5.ApplicationDim iMod As RFEM5.modelSet iApp = GetObject (, ""RFEM5.Application"") Dim rs_no As Integerrs_no = 1 On Error GoTo e ' Checks RS-COM license and locks the application for using by COM. iApp.LockLicense Set iMod = iApp.GetActiveModel ' get module interface Dim iDyn As IDynamModule Set iDyn = iMod.GetModule(""DynamPro"") ' get module case interface Dim iDynCase As IModuleCase Set iDynCase = iDyn.GetData ' set response spectra parameters Dim rspara As RSParams rspara = iDynCase.GetRSParams(rs_no) Dim rs_spec(0 To 10) As RSTableRow Dim index As Integer index = 0 rs_spec(index).s = 0.6 rs_spec(index).T = 0 index = 1 rs_spec(index).s = 1.33 rs_spec(index).T = 0.153 index = 2 rs_spec(index).s = 1.33 rs_spec(index).T = 0.4 index = 3 rs_spec(index).s = 1.204 rs_spec(index).T = 0.443 index = 4 rs_spec(index).s = 1.07 rs_spec(index).T = 0.5 index = 5 rs_spec(index).s = 0.7 rs_spec(index).T = 0.761 index = 6 rs_spec(index).s = 0.508 rs_spec(index).T = 1.051 index = 7 rs_spec(index).s = 0.367 rs_spec(index).T = 1.453 index = 8 rs_spec(index).s = 0.267 rs_spec(index).T = 1,995 index = 9 rs_spec(index).s = 0.16 rs_spec(index).T = 2,584 index = 10 rs_spec(index).s = 0.16 rs_spec(index).T = 5 rspara.UserDefinedTable = rs_spec rspara.Comment = ""test rs"" rspara.DefinitionType = ResponseSpectraType.UserDefinedRS rspara.description = ""test rs via COM"" rspara.Number = rs_no iDynCase.SetRSParams rs_no, rspara e: If Err.Number <> 0 Then MsgBox Err.description, , Err.Source iMod.GetApplication.UnlockLicense Set iMod = Nothing Set iApp = Nothing The response spectrum was created based on EN 1998-1:2010 and has 11 points.

"Can I perform a punching shear check on concrete surfaces that are assigned the ""Orthotropic"" stiffness type?","No, this is not possible: The verification concept for the punching shear verification provides for a static height d that is constant over the critical perimeter. The specification of an orthotropy (e.g. ""effective thickness"") contradicts this design concept. It is therefore not possible to select punching points in surfaces with orthotropic stiffness.If you still want to design the slab with the ""Orthotropic"" stiffness type, you can use RF-PUNCH Pro to perform the punching verification using a copy of the Perform file with surfaces whose stiffness type you change to ""Standard"". If necessary, apply a user-defined punching load in mask 1.5 of RF-PUNCH Pro, as it would result from the system with the orthotropic surfaces."
Can I also set a custom response spectrum in RF-/DYNAM Pro?,"Yes, you can switch to Custom in the General section of the Response Spectrum tab. You can then use the ""Import from Excel"" button to import the parameters from an Excel document. Important: To avoid compatibility problems, is it helpful to first export an empty response spectrum from RF-/DYNAM Pro, fill it in Excel and then import it again."

I would like to retrofit an existing structure with a false ceiling that is not connected to the existing columns. How can I model this?,"I just want to present one way of implementing your project so that you get a result. Our existing structure deforms as follows without a false ceiling. We use the existing structure and also the Drag & Drop function as well as copying elements with pressed CTRL key to model quickly. It is important to ensure that existing articulated connections are mapped correctly. In this example, only a workflow is to be shown so that the connections between columns and slabs are modeled in a rigid manner. The lower supports are shown as nodal supports with the function Column in Z... .The suspended ceiling should not transfer your loads to the existing, continuous supports. To compare the two models, you can evaluate the results using the two subsystems modeled in one file. "
Which static height d is used in RF-PUNCH Pro for the design on surfaces with variable thickness? ,"For surfaces with variable surface thicknesses, RF-PUNCH Pro iteratively determines the lowest static height d along the critical perimeter and uses this for the verification to be on the safe side over the entire perimeter."
I get an error message at the line support that the line is not assigned to any surface. How can I start my calculation?,"A line support describes the boundary conditions of all FE nodes along a line: The displacements and rotations at these internal nodes can be prevented or restricted by displacement and torsion springs. Line supports can only be placed on lines belonging to a surface or solid. The line number must be entered in this column or the input field or selected graphically. If there is no surface or a solid, the error message appears. If you model without surfaces and solids, it is sufficient to delete the line support and the Adapt support conditions. For members - as an alternative to line supports - member bedding can be used to implement elastic support of the member over its entire length."
Is there a function to quickly create a grid or grid?,"Yes, you can quickly create surfaces, grids or grids by extruding lines and members. However, if an irregular grid is to be generated with extended specifications, the Generate Grid dialog is recommended.In our case we want to generate a regular grid and use the function for this Extrude member into grid. Various settings can be made in the Extrude member into grid dialog. As a result, we get the desired grid and can continue modeling with it. "
I edited the material in my model. When starting the calculation I get an error message. What can be the reason?,"Materials are used to define surfaces, cross-sections and solids. The material properties are included in the stiffness of these objects.There are 13 material models available if you use the add-on module RF-MAT NL. Given the abundance of material models, you must ensure that you assign the appropriate material model to the members and their surfaces/solids.In the example shown here, a member has been broken down into surfaces for detailed analysis. An unused cross-section is still defined (marked in blue) and a material is stored for both the member cross-section and the surfaces. When editing the one existing material to Isotropic nonlinear elastic 2D/3D, a 2D/3D material model is also defined for the created member cross section, which leads to the error message. When working with members and surfaces/solids, it is advisable to create more than one material."
How to delete a load case in the project navigator?,"You can delete a selection of load cases in the navigator as follows: Activate the ""Data"" tab in the project navigator.Select the load cases to be deleted under the ""Load Cases and Combinations"" → ""Load Cases"" branch.Right click on the selection and select ""Delete""."
"When calculating a cross-section, I get a message that the weld is not connected to two elements. What should I do?","A weld must be connected to two entities at its two edges. The edges of the weld seam have elements 1, 3 and 5 connected. The cross section must be changed so that two elements connect to the weld seam. This is also shown in the video. "
The definition of the result bar does not seem to be correct. There is no integration area and no results are displayed. What can be the reason?,"If you are using the ""Inside Box - General"" integration option, it may be because you have incorrectly defined the parameters for the catchment area. The feed lengths are to be entered as an amount. This is particularly important in the negative direction: If you enter the indent length as a negative value, this value will be subtracted from the positive direction. Example: You want an integration range of 1 m for the Set result bar. For the ""Inside the cuboid - Square"" option, simply enter an indent length of 1 m. With the ""Inside the cuboid - General"" option, you must enter a length of 0.5 m as an amount in the positive and in the negative direction. These lengths are added and you get a total catchment area of 1 m."
Can I use RF-CONCRETE Surfaces to determine the mass of steel for the reinforcement that was inserted?,"In RF-CONCRETE Surfaces, no quantity determination can be output for an inserted or determined area reinforcement.In RF-CONCRETE Members, RF-CONCRETE Columns and RF-FOUNDATION Pro, however, a reinforcement proposal is output, off which a steel mass can be determined. "
I would like to use the export of visual objects to RWIND Simulation. How do I scale my visual on import?,"3ds files do not include scale information. If you know the maximum dimensions of your object, you can import the visual object in the right scale. The maximum dimension of our visual object is 10 m. We can use this value and set it as the absolute, maximum size in the settings when inserting the visual object. In addition, various points can be selected at which the visual object can be positioned. As a result, our previously modeled construction fits exactly in the desired place. From program version xx.23.01, the visual objects can be used to display as a terrain model or as a Environment model to be exported for the calculation in RWIND Simulation. These objects are therefore also used in the calculation of all load cases in the background. "

All objects that are now within the dashed box are usually also shown in the printout report. Alternatively, in such a case you can of course also use the Use ""As screen view"" setting for graphics printing."
"When using line releases, I cannot understand the definition of the failure. To which axis do the non-linearities ""Fixed if vz positive"" and ""Fixed if vz negative"" refer?","The positive and negative directions refer to the axis system of the line release. The forces, for example vz, are to be related to the object on the original line.In the following, the definition will be briefly explained using the example of a release between wall and ceiling. If the wall is the released object, the definition of uplift failure would be:Between the floor slab and the wall, choose the nonlinearity ""Fixed if vz negative"". Between the wall and the ceiling above, the non-linearity ""Fixed if vz positive"" should be selected. Should the failure be defined incorrectly , this can be checked using the determined deformation image. "

Can I create unusual combinations e.g. B. for fire protection also create automatically?,"In many webinars and online videos, the automatic load case combination, e.g. B. explained for the Eurocode. You can see an example of this here directly on Youtube. However, due to time constraints, these webinars and videos often do not include an unusual combination such as e.g. in the event of a fire or earthquake. This combination can be generated just as easily and flexibly as the combination for the ultimate limit state (ULS) or the serviceability limit state (SLS). The attached video shows this generation. In summary, the following steps are necessary (structure and load cases already defined): Activate automatic combination in the basic data In the Combination Rules tab, select an unusual combination with psi1 or psi2 as the leading Create combinations ideally with an enveloping result combination Result combination created in the add-on module, e.g. B. Select RF-/TIMBER Pro under the ""Fire protection"" tab for the design"
"Which options are available for the serviceability parameters in RF-LAMINATE to calculate the local deformation uz,local used in the design?","You have three options to choose from. Undeformed system: The deformation is related to the initial system.Shifted parallel surface: This option is recommended if the surface is supported in a flexible manner. The deformation uz,local is related to a virtual reference surface shifted parallel to the undeformed system. The displacement vector of the reference surface is as long as the smallest nodal deformation in the surface.Displaced user-defined reference plane: If the bearings of a surface deform very differently, a tilted reference plane for the one to be verified Deformation uz,local can be defined. This plane is defined by three points of the undeformed system. The program determines the deformation of the three definition points, places the reference plane through these shifted points and then calculates the local deformation uz,local."

"I have broken down a clamped pipe cross-section into a surface. After the calculation, error messages about unconnected nodal loads and nodal supports now appear. What should I do?","After dividing the tubular member into a surface, this is no longer connected to the original nodal support. A line support is recommended for the newly created lines at the beginning of the pipe. The nodal load is also no longer connected to the original member. Here, a crossing of rigid members is recommended for load introduction. This transfers the load to the edge lines of the surface. "
"When entering a new material using the Diagram definition type, the first line is locked. How can I define my material?","For the first point, the material's modulus of elasticity is assumed in the material model, so that there is a quasi-initial state for the solver to ensure numerical stability.If you don't load a material, it will when creating the material model using the Diagram definition type, the first point is not calculated as expected and cannot be adjusted in a meaningful way. To avoid this, you must first load a material. After that you can create the material model as usual and also adjust the points. The first point can now be adjusted in relation to the voltage. "
How can I assign specific surfaces to a result member for integrating the internal forces?,"In the detailed settings of the respective result member you can set which objects (members, surfaces or solids) should be taken into account by this result member.If e.g. If, for example, an unexpected result is output for the result bar, this dialog should be used to check whether the integration range for the objects handled has been set correctly."
Opening add-on modules is relatively time-consuming for very large models with results. How can the speed be increased?,"The display of the result tables can be controlled in the details of all additional modules. Here it is helpful to display the results only by load case or by material. In the RF-/STEEL Surfaces module, it is also possible to calculate only enveloping values. Furthermore, it can be helpful to display the results in grid points. For the RF-LAMINATE module there is also the option to completely hide the results of the grid points. You can find a more detailed description here."
"In RF-CONCRETE Members, I can display a rendering of the existing reinforcement in the structure. Is this also possible for the results from RF-CONCRETE Surfaces? In the form of individual rods or mats?","No, unfortunately this is not possible in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces (in the current development status). If you have activated a basic reinforcement and/or the serviceability limit state design in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces, then you have the Results navigator provides several options for graphically displaying the ""existing reinforcement"".However, no rendering of the reinforcing bars or mesh reinforcement is generated here. Rather, it is a colored display of the result values in [cm²/m] for the longitudinal reinforcement or in [cm²/m²] for the shear reinforcement."
How can I model several single-span girders in a row in KRANBAHN?,"You can model several single-span beams one after the other by inserting hinges:Activate ""Hinge"" in the ""1.2 Geometry"" mask,Edit the joints in the ""Joints"" tab that is then active"
"In RSTAB I would like to enter the subgrade coefficient for displacement, shear and torsion springs rigid. Which values do I have to define?","completely rigid storage is not possible.

"The results of my model are there and displayed graphically, but without result values. How can I display the result values?","There are two ways to display the result values:Click on the ""Show results with values"" button in the toolbar. Activate the result values under ""Results"" in the show navigator. "
How can I assign a model file that is not currently assigned to a project to an existing project?,"In this case, the following procedure is suitable:Open the project manager and search for the project to which the file is to be added in the project navigator on the left.Click on this project with the right mouse button and open Windows Explorer. Drag and drop the desired file there and then close Windows Explorer.The The file is now assigned to the desired project."
How can I get the actual rod length of e.g. B. Have ropes handed out?,"You can find this information in the results navigator for the members. The member lengths related to the loaded system and the unloaded system are output there. The ""loaded length"" is obtained from the form-finding, taking into account the prestressesThe back calculation to the ""unloaded length"" can be done manually using Hooke's law:${\text{l} _{\mathrm{unloaded}}\;=\;{\mathrm{l}_{\mathrm{loaded}}\;-\;\mathrm{Δl}\\\\\mathrm\sigma\;=\;\ mathrm E\;\cdot\;\mathrm\varepsilon\\\frac{\mathrm F}{\mathrm A}\;=\;\mathrm E\;\cdot\;\frac{\mathrm{Δl}}}{ \mathrm l}\\\mathrm{Δl}\;=\;\frac{\mathrm F\;\cdot\;\mathrm l}{\mathrm E\;\cdot\;\mathrm A}\\\\ {\text{l}_{\text{unloaded}}\;=\;{\text{l}_{\text{loaded}}\;-\;\frac{\text{F\;\cdot\;{\ mathrm l}_{\mathrm{loaded}}}{\mathrm E\;\cdot\;\mathrm A}\;=\;{\mathrm l}_{\mathrm{loaded}}\;\cdot\; \left(1-\;\frac{\mathrm F\;}{\mathrm E\;\cdot\;\mathrm A}\right)$"
"In my model, bars connect to each other at an angle. Can I assign an oblique cut to the bar ends?","No, this is not possible. Members are nothing more than lines to which a stiffness is assigned via the cross-section definition. Therefore, the member is always ""cut off"" in the rendering perpendicular to the member axis."
Why does an eccentrically placed member receive axial forces even though it is only loaded by shear forces?,"If a member is connected eccentrically to a surface or to another member, you can imagine that each node (RSTAB) and each FE node (RFEM) of each element is coupled to a member . The result is identical to that of the defined eccentricities. The system shown is nothing more than a truss girder with a top chord and a bottom chord, which is connected to each other by means of verticals. As is well known, because of the geometry, the belts are increasingly stressed by normal forces and less by bending moments. "
"On my PC, the characters ""<"" and "">"" no longer shown. Instead, I get wrong symbols (circles) in the additional module for the utilization of the designs or in the printout report. Can you tell me what could be causing this?","Please check the Windows fonts on the PC and check whether the ""Symbol Standard"" font is installed. This is required to display the symbols correctly. "
I can no longer open the dialog for entering the soil profile in FUND Pro. Why?,"The dialog for defining the soil profile is deactivated as soon as the dependent verifications have been deactivated in the detailed settings. Entering a soil profile is not required for the following verifications: Bearing resistance according to EN 1997-1, Annex DVerification of slidingSettlement calculationAs soon as one of the above options is activated, the input dialog for the soil profile is accessible again."
Where is the load applied to the foundation when designing in FUND Pro?,"The load application in RF-/FOUNDATION Pro is always at the upper edge of the foundation, regardless of the foundation type."
How can I model a surface as a quadrant with varying thickness from inside to outside?,"In the case of surfaces with variable thickness, a plane is spanned from three nodes. The result is a wedge, not a cone as desired. It is therefore advisable in this case to divide the quadrant into separate, even surface segments:divide the line of the inner arc using n intermediate nodesdivide the line of the outer arc using n intermediate nodesInsert individual lines, delete original area and redefine individual area segmentsorInsert individual lines, divide original area using integrated linesDefine variable thickness as desired for each individual segment"
Can RSTAB/RFEM files be generated in Tekla without an RSTAB/RFEM license?,"The creation of RSTAB/RFEM files is also possible in Tekla without an RSTAB/RFEM license. However, RSTAB/RFEM must be installed on the computer where Tekla is also installed. It is sufficient to install the test version of RSTAB/RFEM, which can be downloaded here:https://www.dlubal.com/en/downloads-and-info/free-trial/download-trialFor exporting a model from Tekla to RSTAB/RFEM, a statics model must first be created in Tekla. To do this, open the ""Static models"" dialog via the ""Static calculation"" → ""Static models"" tab. The ""New..."" button opens the ""analysis model properties"" dialog, in which the analysis application ""Dlubal File (.NET)"" is to be selected in the ""analysis model"" tab.

How can I take an eccentric load application into account for surfaces?,"You have several options in this regard.On the one hand, you can decompose the eccentric load into the vertical component and the moment component and model the load using line loads. Another possibility is to let the line load act eccentrically on the surface using an additional surface with the surface type - stiffness ""Rigid"". "
What are the graphics speed benefits if I enable OpenGL hardware acceleration? What about using virtual machines?,"RFEM uses OpenGL for the graphic display. If available, RFEM uses the hardware acceleration of the graphics card. If it does not support hardware acceleration, then RFEM uses the software implementation of OpenGL from Windows. If hardware acceleration cannot be used, the graphical representation is essential slower. The extent to which this negatively affects the usability of RFEM depends on the size of the processed RFEM models. For many (not all) hypervisors, the use of hardware-accelerated OpenGL is not possible. RFEM would basically run in the virtual machine. However, the graphic display would be slower. We recommend that you use a typical RFEM model to test whether the speed of RFEM in the virtual machine is acceptable. Please note that our support can only provide very limited support when using virtual machines."
Are the minimum moments also taken into account when punching through foundation plates?,"Yes, minimum moments are also taken into account when punching at foundation plates. See also the FAQ004371 (link below).In the current development status (as of July 2020), however, the beneficial bottom stress within the critical perimeter is not taken into account when determining VEd."
How can a nodal support be rotated?,"A nodal support can be rotated as follows:Open the ""Edit nodal support"" dialog box,Under ""Bearing Axis System"" activate the option ""Custom Axis System: Rotated""Click the ""Edit Custom Axis System"" button In the Edit Custom Axis System dialog box, set the bearing rotation options as desired"
I have defined a notch on the support. Why is this not taken into account in the reduction coefficient kv?,"The influence of the stress concentration in the notch must be taken into account when verifying the load-bearing capacity. This is guaranteed by the reduction coefficient kv according to DIN EN 1995-1-1, 6.5.1. The calculation of kv is defined in DIN EN 1995-1-1 in formulas 6.61 to 6.63. Further specifications for the reduction coefficient can also be found in the national appendices.In our example, the reduction coefficient kv is determined as expected. With the other system, the reduction coefficient kv is determined as 1.222. This The example is due to the fact that the static system and the load on the supports create a supporting moment. This means that according to DIN EN 1995- 1-1, 6.5.1 (2) the influence of stress concentration can be neglected. ""The influence of the stress concentration may be neglected in the following cases:[...] Bending with compressive stresses in the notch.10b"".In our example, the reduction coefficient can be calculated according to the specifications in DIN EN 1995-1-1/NA formula (NA.60) can even be greater than 1.0."
How can you center the coordinate system of a surface?,"Surfaces in RFEM consist of a group of finite elements. Each element has its own local coordinate system. The alignment of all elements belonging to the surface is regulated by the overall surface definition.You can achieve a centric alignment of the individual elements in the surface properties under the ""Axes"" tab with an alignment on a line. To do this, the program needs a specification of the radial direction (x or y direction) and a description of the straight line through the center over two points. The program then aligns the individual element coordinate systems in such a way that a straight line through the element origin intersects the static center line in the radial direction on the element level. "
Can I use the table to evaluate which member has the greatest cutting forces in relation to others?,"Yes, this is possible. The result tables show in color whether there are positive or negative internal forces and what the relationship is to the extreme values. Negative values are symbolized by red bars, positive ones by blue bars. This means that a visual evaluation of the results is also possible in the table. In the result tables of the design modules, the respective utilization factors are expressed by the colors. The decisive design points are immediately apparent."
Which port does the geo-zone tool web service use?,"The geo zone tool is a pure web application. Consequently, the associated web service can be controlled via system port 443."
Is there an interface between LayPLAN by Layher and RSTAB/RFEM?,"Yes, data can be exchanged between the LayPLAN software from Layher and RSTAB. The ""LayPLAN TO RSTAB"" tool creates this possibility. Scaffolding constructions can be conveniently transferred to RSTAB. The ""LayPLAN TO RSTAB"" interface transfers geometry data as well as structurally relevant information such as cross-section and material data, member types, eccentricities and non-linear connection definitions in accordance with the approval. An active license from RS-COM is required to operate this interface RSTAB required. RS-COM is available as an unlimited license and also as a rental license."

What is the difference between the add-on modules RF-/STEEL and RF-/STEEL EC3?,"Even if the names of the modules are very similar, the calculations that are carried out are different.RF-/STEELThis additional module carries out a general stress analysis by using existing Stresses are calculated and compared with the limit stresses. The verifications are performed elastically. The verifications are not dependent on a standard.RF-/STEEL EC3This add-on module, on the other hand, carries out all the typical structural safety, stability, deformation and fire protection verifications for steel members according to Eurocode 3 ( numerous national annexes available). Numerous module extensions are available within this additional module. These include: warping torsion analysis, plasticity analysis, checks for cold-formed profiles.Comparison of both modulesThe results of RF-/STEEL can be compared with the results of the cross-section check of RF-/STEEL EC3 . Why the results can differ is explained in FAQ 003489 explained."
"Unfortunately, the connection I created cannot be calculated. Error number 30863 appears.

In RF-/FE-BUCKLING I get the message that the minimum distance between the stiffeners is not observed. What should I do?,"The message is displayed if the ""Minimum distance between stiffeners: 30 ε t"" checkbox is activated in the details and the clear distance between the stiffeners is less than this minimum distance amin is. The minimum distance is calculated as followsamin = 30 ⋅ ε ⋅ tThese are:ε = √(235 / fy [N/mm²])fy ... Yield strengtht ... Thickness of the buckling field In this case, the distance between the stiffeners must be increased in the ""1.2 Buckling Stiffeners"" mask. For the buckling panel, the clearance between the stiffeners is: Δz = z2 - z1 - (t1 + t2) / 2= 890 - 600 - (10 + 10) / 2 = 280 mmThis distance is smaller than the minimum distance: amin = 30 ⋅ ε ⋅ t = 30 ⋅ √(235 / 355) ⋅ 12 = 292.9 mmThe position of the buckling stiffener 2 should therefore be at least z2 = z1 + (t1 + t2) / 2 + a min = 600 + (10 + 10) / 2 + 292.9 ≈ 903 mm be specified.This distance is also output as information in the ""1.2 Bucket Stiffeners"" window if the mouse pointer is placed over buckling stiffener 2.

"When making an entry in the RF-/STEEL EC3 add-on module, I get the error message ""Invalid position of the intermediate support"". What is the reason?","Inputting intermediate supports is intended for entering lateral supports on a bar without having to insert a node in the model at this point. They are also required when designing sets of members using the equivalent member method in order to define existing support conditions at the intermediate nodes of the set of members.The intermediate supports entered are then taken into account as additional boundary conditions in the eigenvalue solver. However, some boundary conditions are already contained in the input masks for the nodal supports or the effective lengths.In order to prevent conflicts or double entries for the same point, the error message ""Invalid position of the intermediate support"" appears. The following positions are not permitted because they are already defined via the other entries:Design of members: - start and end of the member Design of sets of members: - Start and end of all members when input is via nodal supports - Start and end of the set of members when designing with the equivalent member method However, troubleshooting is very easy, because after confirming the error message, the first line with the wrong input is automatically selected."
How can I define a smoothing area on pipes over the entire circumference?,"If you have modeled your pipe surface as a quadrangle surface, this is possible by dividing the surface at least once. After that define a new smoothing area for the surface by picking the center, specifying the dimension, defining the vector and determining what kind of smoothing you want. You can use the vector entirely set simply by grabbing two points. "
I can no longer find a cross-section from an older version. Has this been removed?,"The cross-section you want is most likely a cross-section from an old standard.

How can I put together special program packages with Dlubal Software?,"The Dlubal software has a modular structure. You can assemble the software as you wish. You always need a main program. Either the RSTAB for frameworks or RFEM for general finite element calculations (framework, surfaces and volume elements). Depending on the task, you can configure the required additional modules. We can give general recommendations as to which program combination is possible, but it is better if you take some time and select the modules according to your specific needs. Additional modules that are not required can simply be omitted or quickly reordered if required. You can therefore only buy the product performance that you actually need.

How can I protect a custom block from accidental modification?,"Open the block manager, select the block to be protected and then press the right mouse button. Then select ""Set as read-only"". If the block is to be unlocked again, this works in the same way."
"How can individual members be deactivated for the calculation, for example to simulate a column failure?","There are two ways to do this:The corresponding member can be defined as a zero member. This means that it is not taken into account in the calculation of all load cases and load combinations.The corresponding member can be deactivated in all or only for certain load cases and/or load combinations. To do this, the ""Modify stiffnesses"" option must first be activated in the calculation parameters of the load case or load combination. The desired member can then be deactivated in the additional register window.However, the following points should be observed:When using the zero member, a warning message appears if there are member loads were defined.In the case of generated loads, the loads are automatically redistributed when the zero member is used.If the member is deactivated in the calculation parameters, the member loads and the determined generated loads are also ignored . No error message appears for this. The loads must be redistributed manually."
"In connection with the analytical SLS calculation, I get implausibly large values for the crack width and the deformation in the RF-CONCRETE modules. What is the cause and how can I fix the problem?","In connection with the analytical calculation of the SLS, it should be noted that the calculation is based on an existing reinforcement or one applied for the SLS. The existing reinforcement can be e.g. B. result from the verification of the load-bearing capacity, the defined basic reinforcement or the automatically determined reinforcement required for the SLS. The reinforcement applied for the SLS verification can be output graphically. Cause of the problem: If in some areas there is too little or no reinforcement from the ULS or the basic reinforcement and no reinforcement required for the SLS is determined at the same time, then the check is carried out in the serviceability limit state with no or too little reinforcement. In this context, e.g. B. very high results occur in the deformation. Poor convergence can also occur. Solving the problem:It should be ensured that that there is reinforcement in every area of the system. This can e.g. B. by applying a basic reinforcement or a minimum reinforcement. "
How can I quickly transfer a load from one load case to another? I accidentally entered my loads into the wrong load case.,"A load that was accidentally applied in the wrong load case can be copied from one load case to another using the ""3.

"am trying to verify RF-CONCRETE surfaces based on the results from the example manual. Section 2.4.3 describes how to determine the statically required reinforcement. Unfortunately, I can't create an example that exactly reflects these results. Can you send me the related example?",You can find the corresponding example as a download via the link below.The results shown in FIgure 2.39 in the RF-CONCRETE Surfaces manual come from the reinforcement in the lower layer in grid point R27 - see the graphic below with the design details for that point. 
"A dialog is shown in the manual that shows six options: Load Cases, Actions, Combination Rules, Action Combinations, Load Combinations, Result Combinations. But I only have three options to choose from. How do I get the six options displayed?","If the load cases are superimposed manually, the ""Edit Load Cases and Combinations"" dialog offers only three options. The specification for this is made in the ""General information"" dialog. If you activate the ""Generate combinations automatically"" check box there, you receive the additional options (actions, combination rules , action combinations) as desired. "

How can I adapt the wind tunnel to the model in RWIND Simulation?,"If the model is not placed correctly in the wind tunnel, the wind tunnel can be placed around the model using the ""Fit to model"" function in the wind tunnel properties. In this step, the function places the wind tunnel floor at the bottom of the model and places the remaining wind tunnel sides next to the model with a usual spacing depending on the model dimension.

"In RWIND Simulation, I took the neighboring buildings and the terrain into account via an import. This data is no longer available when the RWIND simulation is recalculated from RFEM. What can I do?","With the release of the program version RFEM 5.23.01, a new option ""Simulate and generate wind load"" is available in the settings of the RWIND simulation. 3ds files inserted in RFEM can be exported to RWIND Simulation as a terrain model or as an environment model. It is also possible to consider an IFC or STEP file imported as a CAD/BIM model in RWIND Simulation. "
"RWIND Simulation load cases exist in my RFEM file. After the FE mesh has been deleted, these load cases are no longer available. However, these load cases are still present in the automatically generated combinations and I get an error message when I start the calculation. What can I do?","If you want to take the load cases into account again, please carry out a new RWIND simulation calculation. If you would like to carry out the calculation of the existing combinations, please remove the RWIND simulation load cases from the wind action before deleting the FE mesh. The combinations are then re-formed and a calculation is possible."
"What is set with the option ""Calculate result values of grid points for graphics""?","The calculation of the results in the grid points is important, among other things, for the display of the values on surfaces. You can find information about the grid points here. The problem is that with larger structures and many load combinations, the calculation in the grid points is relatively time-consuming and therefore requires a large amount of memory. Even if the user carries out the calculation in the FE nodes, the calculation must also be carried out in the grid points. Otherwise, no results can be displayed in grid points under Values on surfaces. For large structures, it is advisable to switch off this option to perform a faster calculation. "
How can the number of mesh elements on the model for the numerical flow analysis be kept low despite a very delicate model contour?,"With activated model simplification, RWIND Simulation generates a ""shrink-wrapping"" mesh similar to a shrink film around the model geometry before the actual finite volume meshing. The program takes the desired mesh size of this envelope network from the respectively assigned model level of detail. This minimum mesh size specifies the finite volume element size in the vicinity next to the envelope mesh and, in cooperation with the globally defined mesh density, also specifies the finite volume mesh size distribution between the envelope mesh on the model and the wind tunnel boundary surfaces. The fine meshing in the near model area is necessary for a good recording of the turbulence effect and for recording a real boundary layer distribution.However, since the resulting pressures on the model geometry are adjusted by transformation at the transition points between the finite volume mesh and the envelope mesh , the envelope mesh does not necessarily have to have the same mesh geometry as the enclosing finite volume mesh. This fact allows an optimization of the envelope mesh geometry in terms of the number of elements with a variable size distribution to capture a correct geometry. Such an optimization of the simplified ""shrink wrapping"" - Envelope mesh geometry can be activated in RWIND Simulation via the optimization option in the model properties. To control the number of elements on the envelope mesh geometry, an expected number of elements range with a minimum and maximum limit value can be specified in the option properties. p> "

"When opening an RFEM file, the entries in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces are lost. Can this be?","Yes, this is possible if you e.g. For example, you can open a file (calculated in version 5.23.01) in an older version (e.g. 5.20.01).The additional modules for reinforced concrete construction are not backwards compatible. This means that depending on the version jump, module entries must be deleted.This can e.g. This may be necessary, for example, if the newer program version contains a function or feature that was not yet available in the older version. To avoid compatibility problems, the entries in the modules are deleted.In the example, the file from version 5.23.01 is opened in version 5.20.01. In this case, the entries from RF-CONCRETE Surfaces are lost. For example, if this file B. opened in version 5.17.01, the input from RF-CONCRETE Members was also lost. To avoid the problem, we recommend concluding a service contract and using the current version of RFEM. "
"In RF-/JOINTS Steel - DSTV I get the message ""Wrong angle between the members"" and ""Invalid material"". Which entries do I have to adjust?","The connections in the RF-/JOINTS Steel - DSTV module are typical steel construction connections for the transmission or introduction of moments and shear forces. At the note ""Wrong angle between the members"" is to check whether the connection geometry corresponds to the requirements of the typified connections. Discrepancies in the model input can also be a reason here. In the example, a small deviation in the Y-axis coordinates results in incorrect model geometry. If you see the ""Inadmissible material"" notice, check whether the material is intended for the typed connection. The material S 235 or S 355 can be selected for these connections for profiles and sheets."
Both 2D and 3D licenses of RFEM/RSTAB are available on the network license. How can I ensure that I start the 2D version and not occupy a 3D license?,"The problem is that only the shortcut to the 3D version is created on the desktop during installation.When the program starts, authorization is checked. If the 3D version is available there, the 3D version will also be started. However, if there is no 3D version there, it is checked whether a 2D version is licensed. If this is the case, the restricted 2D version is started automatically.In order for the 2D version to be started if a 3D license is available, the shortcut on the desktop must be adjusted.Copy the link and rename it accordingly.Then please right-click on the link and select the ""Properties"" option from the context menu and add the path to *64.exe the entry "" /2D""."
"For a composite cross-section in SHAPE-THIN, the shear area Ay is larger than the total cross-sectional area A. How can that be?","Strange values of the shear areas, i.e. larger than A, can occur, for example, with parametric thin-walled profiles that have an atypical geometry and may not be ideally thin-walled. The shear areas are calculated according to the theory of thin-walled cross-sections in SHAPE-THIN. Therefore, the defined cross-section should have reasonable dimensions in terms of width-to-thickness ratios. With the thickness t* of the connecting zero element, the shear transmission and thus the value of the shear area can be influenced."

"Can the input values for the temperature profiles stored in the fire protection certificate be adjusted? For example, I would like to adjust the moisture content input value.","The temperature profiles from Annex A EN 1992-1-2 are used as a basis for the fire protection verification. The input parameters for the temperature profiles can be set in the modules (RF -/CONCRETE Members and RF-/CONCRETE Columns) cannot be adjusted. The temperature curves according to Annex A EN 1992-1-2 are based on the following assumptions: The specific heat of concrete corresponds to the information according to EN 1992-1-2, 3.2.2.The humidity is 1.5%. For moisture levels greater than 1.5%, the temperatures shown are on the safe side. The thermal conductivity of concrete is the lower limit from EN 1992-1-2, 3.3.3.The emissivity for the concrete surface is 0.7.The convective heat transfer coefficient is 25 W/m^2K."
Why is a trapezoidal and not a triangular load shown for a distributed load with a linear load curve (from 0 to 50kN/m²)? ,"It is due to the relative limit settings that can be set for each load type in the display settings. In order for the load to be displayed as a triangle, it is necessary to reduce the minimum value for ""1 [kN/m²]"". The smallest value that can be set is 0.1%. The relative limit settings are used to set the minimum and maximum display size in relation to the maximum dimensions of the overall model."
I carry out a fire protection analysis in RF-/CONCRETE columns. Which source does the verification formula according to Section 5.8.8 refer to?,"The fire protection design with RF-/CONCRETE columns is carried out according to the simplified calculation method according to EN 1992-1-2 [1], Section 4.2. The zone method described in Appendix B.2 is used here: The reduction in load-bearing capacity in the event of fire is represented by a reduction in the component cross-section and a reduction in the strength of the building materials. The equivalent cross-section used for the fire design does not take into account the concrete areas directly exposed to the fire and thus worn down. The fire protection verification is then carried out with the reduced cross-section and the reduced building material properties analogous to the load-bearing capacity verification at normal temperature. That means: The nominal curvature method according to [1] , par. 5.8.8 is performed with the hot materials and reduced cross-section. "
How can I transfer the shear force transfer in joints to the printout report?,The intermediate results of the add-on module can be added to the Reinforcement tab in the printout report selection.
Where can I find information about the default limit values for the deformation analysis in the STEEL EC3 add-on module?,"For building construction, no specific limit values are specified in the standards for the proof of serviceability.

"In the context of concrete design, is it possible to base the design on a custom National Annex?","Yes, the National Annex parameters can be customized. To do this, a new user-defined National Annex must first be created. The newly created attachment will be based on the original attachment selected previously. Once the attachment has been created, the parameters can be modified. The name of the national attachment can also be customized. The custom attachment is marked with ""*"". "
"In connection with the non-linear calculation of reinforced concrete, is there a function in the program that increases the load to failure? Or is there a procedure for mapping an increase in load up to failure?","There is no such function for increasing the load until failure in connection with the calculation of reinforced concrete structures. Alternatively, you can proceed as follows: A separate load case or load combination must be created for each load level. This can e.g. This can also be done using load factors, for example. The individual load cases or combinations must then be selected in the module for design. After the calculation has run through to the ""Existing reinforcement"" point for the first time, the existing reinforcement proposed by the module can be adjusted and saved. Finally, the nonlinear calculation can be performed based on the defined reinforcement. The evaluation of the existing safety or the existing utilization can be done graphically after the calculation has been carried out successfully."
"When designing a slab, I get different reinforcements in different load situations with the same bending stress. What can be the reason?","When dimensioning on the 3D model, the normal forces must be taken into account. The normal force can influence the stress in the respective direction, but can also influence the minimum applied lever arm. In RF-CONCRETE surfaces, the smaller one becomes in 3D structures Lever arm applied from both reinforcement directions. In this context, the normal force in direction 1 can affect the required reinforcement in direction 2."
Is it possible to print an external graphic in the log?,"External graphics can be inserted into the printout report in RFEM and RSTAB.To insert a picture, the graphic must be copied to the clipboard with [Ctrl+C].

To do this, take a screenshot of the clipping layer and copy it to the clipboard."
How can I read out the stresses of a surface via RF-COM?,"The stresses on a surface can be read out via the COM interface. First you need the interface to the model (IModel) and then the interface to the calculation (ICalculation2).

"Using RF-STABILITY and RF-IMP, I calculated a pre-deformed structure according to the second-order theory. Why are the deformations of the LK smaller than the applied pre-deformation?","In RF-IMP you have selected the ""Generate the pre-deformed FE mesh"" option. The imperfect structure is taken into account in the calculation using the deformed FE mesh created in RF-IMP. The results of the LC then refer to the coordinates of the pre-deformed FE mesh and no longer to the original position in the perfect system. I have the coordinates to better explain the topic of the pre-deformed FE mesh nodes exported from RF-IMP to Excel. From this information, an imperfect structure was then created in a new RFEM file and calculated according to the second-order theory. The left window shows the deformation of the perfect structure taking RF-STABILITY and RF-IMP into account, and the right window shows the result of the imperfect structure. The results are identical."
Which load direction should be selected for members and surfaces in the event of a wind load?,"""Local z"" should be selected for the load direction from wind stress. This is due to the fact that the wind load in all standards is usually shown at right angles to the load plane."
How are the total loads and the total moments about the zero point calculated for the different load generators?,"The total load results from the sum of all applied loads per cell area. From the individual load sums, the moments in each direction, related to the coordinate origin, are also displayed. In the attached example this can be understood for a very simple system."
"In RF-/DYNAM Pro - Equivalent Loads there are the result tables ""5.8/5.9/5.10 - Equivalent Loads"". What total is displayed for the ""All mode shapes"" option?",The sum given in this table does not reflect the correct overlay according to the standard. A simple summation of the equivalent loads takes place. An overlay with the selected overlay rule (SRSS or CQC) is not performed in this table! There are also differences if random torsion is activated in the additional module. This means that two load cases are generated for each mode shape. They each contain the torsional moment in the positive and in the negative direction. This means that the equivalent loads are doubled in this table.
How can I design a ribbed slab in state II with RF-CONCRETE NL and use the export of the stiffnesses from the modules?,"First of all, the ribbed slab should not be modeled with the classic ribbed member from RFEM, but with an eccentric beam member that is arranged on the underside of the actual slab. Ribbed members cannot be calculated with RF-CONCRETE NL with regard to the deformations.Then, the eccentric beam member is designed in RF-CONCRETE Members. ""Nonlinear design"" can be activated in the ""Serviceability"" tab of window 1.1. In the detailed settings for the non-linear calculation, the export of the rigidity from the non-linear calculation can be activated. In this example, the rigidity is ""individual"". exported for each CO calculated in RF-CONCRETE Members. Further information on the options ""Individual"" and ""Suitable for the reference load"" can also be found in the following links (see below).After the calculation in RF-CONCRETE Members, the exported stiffnesses of the calculated COs are available in RFEM available and can be activated there in the respective LK's for a new calculation of the internal forces. For this purpose, the additional options must be activated in the basic information of the respective LK. The stiffness exported from the RF-CONCRETE Members module can then be activated in the ""Additional Options"" tab for a new determination of internal forces. After the internal forces of the COs in RFEM (taking into account the exported stiffness from RF-CONCRETE Members), these can be applied for a design in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces.The graphic below shows the deformations of the ribbed slab in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces under Consideration of the stiffness in state II from the design in RF-CONCRETE Members. The linear- elastic stiffness in state I is applied. Notes on the above procedure: In this case, First, the calculation is performed in RF-CONCRETE Members and the resulting stiffness is exported. This procedure was chosen because it was assumed that the eccentric rectangular cross-section will first go into state II.The variant shown ""only"" describes one iteration and is therefore only an ""approximation"", since the calculation of the eccentric rectangular cross-section was assumed to be an uncracked plate.The shrinkage effect is applied as an external load in the NL calculation in RF-CONCRETE Members. This means that e.g. For example, additional curvature would result from asymmetrical reinforcement, even if the cross-section remained in state I. When calculating the slab in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces, this shrinkage effect on the member cross-section is no longer taken into account."
How can the wind speeds at a certain height above the ground be output for a wind comfort study?,"The RWIND Simulation program outputs the size of the wind speeds around the model body under the result Velocity field. When this type of result is displayed, the program automatically switches to a ""slicer"" display. This type of representation shows the scalar result, which is spatially available at all positions between the model bodies, only in the area of one level (slicer). For a wind comfort analysis, the wind speed result is usually required at a certain distance from the traffic area. To do this, do the following: Turn on the velocity field result. Rotate the slicer levels into a parallel level to the traffic area to be analyzed. Set the desired distance of the slicer level to the traffic area in the settings by entering a height. "
Can I also use a SHAPE-THIN 9 cross-section in older versions of RFEM or RSTAB?,"Yes, this is possible. All you have to do is open the cross-section created in SHAPE-THIN 9 (file extension *.du9) in SHAPE-THIN 8 and edit it there as a SHAPE-THIN 8 cross-section (file extension *.du8).To open the cross-section in SHAPE-THIN 8, set the file type to ""All files"". You can now save the cross-section as usual as a SHAPE-THIN 8 cross-section and also import it into older program versions."
"Why is there a fully plastic section modulus Wpl,full and a maximum plastic section modulus Wpl,max for some profiles?","The fully plastic section modulus Wpl,full is related to the fully plastic bending moment Mpl,full. With Mpl,full there is only one internal force in the respective direction. It is not possible to increase this internal force - even if the cross-section has not yet been plasticized.The maximum plastic bending moment Mpl,max, with which the maximum plastic section modulus W pl,max, on the other hand, refers to the state in which the cross-section is completely plasticized. An interaction of the internal forces in the y- and z-direction is also possible."
Can I use RFEM to define a beam with a specific reinforcement and then get a design of this reinforcement with utilization?,"Yes, this is possible with RFEM and the add-on modulesRF-CONCRETE Members and RF-CONCRETE NL possible. For RSTAB you need the additional module CONCRETE.You can define an ""existing basic reinforcement"" in the design modules of RFEM or RSTAB and carry out a non-linear design for this reinforcement in the ultimate limit state.As a result, you receive the course of the ratio from the non-linear calculation assuming the existing longitudinal reinforcement.Note: The non-linear design is already included in the add-on module CONCRETE for RSTAB. The add-on module RF-CONCRETE NL is required in RFEM."
"When entering the geometry of my ribbed deck made of wood, I always get the error message 30343: ""The calculated stiffness matrix is not positive definite"". How can I define the area?","When using wooden materials in RFEM, you will be informed that the ""Isotropic linear elastic"" material model is only suitable for the calculation with members, since the Poisson's ratio is very large. A different material model must be selected for surfaces. If you have assigned the material with an orthotropic material model to the surface, certain orthotropy types cannot be selected. This material is not intended to be used for ribbed ceilings. However, if you have assigned the material to the surface with an isotropic linear elastic material model, you can access all orthotropic access types. When entering the geometry for the ribbed ceiling, error message 30343 appears due to the incorrectly assigned wood material for the surface: ""The calculated stiffness matrix is not positive definite"". "
"have a circular surface with symmetrical loading. However, the results are unsymmetrical. What can be the reason?","The axis alignment of the surfaces is probably not adjusted in your model. For a circular surface, it's best to align either the axes of the surfaces or the axes of the results of the surfaces. You can adjust the axes for each surface. The sub-tabs ""Axes for input"" and ""Axes for results"" are available in the ""Axes"" tab. The ""Axes for results"" tab adjusts the axes of the surface for the results. Here, for example, the axes can be aligned using a point. The big advantage of this method is that the results are not deleted when the axes are adjusted. The ""Axes for input"" tab adjusts the axes of the surface for alignment and results. Here, for example, the axes can be aligned to a line. The results of both axis adjustments are the same. They produce the expected symmetrical results under symmetrical loading. "
"want to design a pane of glass with temperature loads. The message appears that the load case contains types of surface loads ""Temperature"" that are not transferred to the created temporary model. How can I take temperature loads into account?","Temperature loads as area loads on general glass cross-sections cannot be taken into account in the program-internal modeling by volume elements. With the default settings, the glass pane is modeled using 3D volume elements. In the 2D calculation, however, temperature loads are possible as area loads. You can adjust this in the layering details so that a 2D calculation (plate theory) is performed. If necessary, the shear bond between the layers can also be taken into account. You can find further details on the calculation and use of laminated glass in the technical article ""Calculation and use of laminated glass"". After the successful calculation, you will receive the results for the respective layer structure."
In my model I use members with the cross-section IPE 140. Why does the cross-section of the members change when I insert new members as IPE 200? How can I enter different cross sections?,"There are several options when creating members. A cross-section can be specified for the start and end of a member.You can adopt a new cross-section from the cross-section library. You can create a new cross section. You can edit an existing cross section. With this option, however, the cross-section already used is modified: All members to which cross-section 1 is assigned receive the new cross-section after editing. "
"In the case of sections, I don't see a smoothing line for result combinations. What can I do?","In the default setting of the section results for result combinations, the ""Max and Min values"" are displayed. Smoothing does not make sense here.As soon as you switch the display of results to ""Max values"" or ""Min values"", you get the smoothing line. "
How to create the cut geometry for a decorative sticker on a biaxially curved membrane roof?,"The geometry of a sticker on a biaxially curved membrane roof has to be developed depending on its position on the roof and its direction of projection. To ensure that the sticker elements can be applied to the curved base without creases, the projection of the graphic to be shown on the curved base must be leveled. You can carry out the geometric transversion in RFEM as follows: Import the graphic to be displayed as a background layer into the model via the DXF interface. Depending on the imported DXF graphic, define cutting lines on the curved basic shape in the desired projection direction. Create on the intersection points of the cutting lines and the respective intermediate areas nodes on the base form. Copy the newly created node construct on the base form into a new model file. Create Use spline lines between the intersection and intermediate nodes in the new model for each section. Define a membrane area element depending on the sticker material properties into the area enclosed by the spline lines. Create a cutting pattern for each unit area and calculate the flattened sticker geometries."
How can a solid of revolution be created?,"A body of revolution can be created with the ""Rotate"" function. First select the surface to be rotated and then open the ""Rotate - Copy"" dialog with the menu command 'Edit → Rotate', the object context menu or the corresponding button in the toolbar. The number of copies must then be defined as one in the ""Rotate - Copy"" dialog. The desired angle of rotation and the axis of rotation must also be specified. In the ""Detailed settings for move/rotate/mirror"" dialog, which can be accessed via the ""More detailed settings"" button can be opened, activate the ""Create new solids between the selected surfaces and their copies"" checkbox. After clicking on the With the [OK] button, the solid is created. "
Warning 11003 appears after load transfer from another model. Some free loads appear to be perpendicular to the projection plane. What can I do?,"The projection plane and the load direction are different parameters and independent of each other. While the load direction is the actual direction of the applied load, the projection plane describes it together with the associated coordinates of the load position, from which plane the position of the load is projected onto the loaded surfaces. In the sample file, a perpendicular to the load stationary surface selected for the free load. As a result, a warning appears during the calculation. With free loads, it is therefore always important to ensure that all surfaces are in the correct projection plane."
want to input a reinforced concrete beam that is wider on the bottom than on the top. Do I need to define two separate beam bars and couple them? Or is there a special cross-section type?,"As an alternative to the rectangular cross-section, there is also an ""asymmetrical coating"" that can be created as a cross-section via the cross-section library. This cross-section can then also be created be designed in RF-CONCRETE Members or CONCRETE."
How can a checkered load be generated?,"It is recommended to create separate load cases for each field that is to be loaded. The loads are then to be generated panel by panel in the individual load cases. Free rectangular or polygonal loads allow the input of surface loads on a freely definable area of the surface. Alternatively, the surface can be divided into partial surfaces and a surface load applied.In addition, the load cases including the loads can be generated with the RF-MOVE Surfaces add-on module. Checkerboard-like arrangements of the Loads can then be created in the load combinations or result combinations by combining the individual load cases. The manual creation and generation of the load cases and loads with RF-MOVE Surfaces is shown in the video. "
Is it possible to extrude a surface into a solid along a curved line or a circle?,"The ""Extrude"" function can be used to quickly generate three-dimensional bodies from flat surfaces. The function is called up via the surface context menu. To do this, click on the area with the right mouse button. In the menu select the function ""Extrude → Volume"". A dialog appears in which various parameters can be defined. For example, the height h can be entered directly or determined graphically with the mouse. "
"carry out the proof of stability of a beam against lateral torsional buckling. Why is the modified reduction coefficient χLT,mod used in the verification according to DIN EN 1993-1-1, 6.3.3 Method 2? Can this be deactivated?","According to DIN EN 1993-1-1, 6.3.2.3 (2), the reduction coefficient χLT can be reduced by the factor f to χLT,mod be modified. You can activate or deactivate this option in the details of the national annex. "
Can I display natural frequencies separately for the individual directions?,"Spatial models in which multiple directions are selected in the RF-/DYNAM Pro - Natural Vibrations module do not output mode shapes separately for the individual directions. It can happen that a mode shape is dominated by vibrations in one direction (thus only mass excites in one direction, such as only in X-direction). However, it is also possible that a mode shape exhibits vibrations in several directions at the same time (i.e. masses are excited in two or more directions, such as in the X and Y directions at the same time). The mode shapes are therefore not dependent on the global coordinate system, but on the stiffness of the structure in the individual directions.You can check the direction in which the dominant vibration of a mode shape acts by looking at the table ""Effective Modal Mass Factors"" and checks whether mass has been excited in the individual directions. From the effective modal masses that the 1st eigenmode acts exclusively in the Y-direction, the second in the X-direction and the third is a torsional vibration. It is possible to define several natural vibration cases and only activate masses in one direction. In this way, the mode shapes are obtained separately for each direction. "
How is the plastic torsion determined in the plastic hinge definition?,"The plastic torsion is automatically determined for each hinge based on the previously determined cross-section and the member length. The following formula is used for this: $\varphi_{y,pl}=\frac{W_{y,pl}\cdot f_y\cdot l_b}{6\cdot E\ cdot I_y}$ "
"When designing a set of members in STEEL EC3, I cannot specify any buckling lengths. Am I doing something wrong?","In RF-/STEEL EC3, in addition to the stability analyzes in Sections 6.3.1 to 6.3.3 EN 1993-1-1 (equivalent member method), the general method according to 6.3.4 EN 1993-1-1 is also available to the user . This can also be expanded with the following options:~ The European lateral-torsional buckling curve, which is regulated, for example, in the German national appendix to EN 1993 .~ The extension for biaxial bending based on a dissertation by Dr. Naumes.~ The interpolation between buckling and lateral-torsional buckling. When designing sets of members according to the general method, the ""1.7 Nodal support - Sets of Members"" provides a window in which the nodal supports are displayed graphically on the set of members. This makes the general method a useful addition to the other verification formats, which has proven particularly effective in the design of haunches. Entering buckling lengths is obsolete with this method. In the ""Details"" of the add-on module, under the ""Stability"" tab, you can select the method to be used for sets of members. The equivalent member method may only be used for straight sets of members with a uniform cross-section (i.e. not for haunches). For members with variable cross-sections, the default General Method should be used."

Can the second-order theory also be considered in a dynamic analysis in RSTAB?,"There is a detailed technical article (linked at the end of the FAQ) for considering the second-order theory in a dynamic order in RFEM. This entry mainly describes the use of the add-on module RF-DYNAM Pro - Equivalent Loads. This add-on module cannot be taken into account in RSTAB. In RSTAB, you must use the add-on module DYNAM Pro - Forced Vibrations use. Because in this add-on module, the results are calculated completely within the add-on module. If you exported load cases first, the internal forces could not be calculated in relation to the changed stiffness matrix."
"Is the ""extended zone method"" used in the fire protection design in RF-CONCRETE columns?","Yes, when selecting the national appendix ""DIN"", the ""extended zone method"" according to DIN EN 1992-1-2, appendix B.2 is used for the fire protection design."
I have several columns with different cross-sections in my model. How can I assign the reinforcement of the maximum loaded column to columns with the same cross-section?,"Basically, RF-/CONCRETE Columns designs the statically required reinforcement for the verification of buckling and generates a reinforcement proposal on this basis. But you can also do this as an alternative specify a certain minimum reinforcement content before starting the calculation. The entry for this is in the ""1.4 Reinforcement"" mask in the tab for the selected National Annex for EN 1992-1-1 (e.g. DIN EN 1992-1-1). With the input made here, a new reinforcement proposal is defined, with which the verification is carried out."
"What does ""principal load"" and ""secondary load"" mean in RF-PUNCH Pro and where does this load come from?","In RF-PUNCH Pro, a primary and secondary load is determined if a compressive and tensile force is introduced at a punching shear point (e.g. a column). This can be the case, for example, when a result combination (RC) is calculated that results from a previous dynamic analysis with RF-/DYNAM Pro.In this case, tension and stresses can occur at a connection of a column to a floor compressive forces arise. The module analyzes both ""punching directions"" individually and outputs them as ""main load"" and ""secondary load""."
How can a line grid be added to a visibility?,"Visibility settings are available for line grids as for other objects such as nodes, members, etc.If the visibility should also contain the line grid in addition to the objects, then the relevant objects and the line grid must be selected. The selected objects can then be displayed as a section using the ""Visibility using selected objects"" button. Alternatively, a user-defined visibility can be created using the ""Create new user-defined visibility"" button. So that the line grid can be selected, the FAQ 4385 Please note. If the line grid is to be displayed in addition to the generated/user-defined visibilities, the line grid must be created as a user-defined visibility. Creating a user-defined visibility is shown in FAQ 4436 . The line grid can now be displayed next to the generated or custom visibilities by checking the check box of the line grid custom visibility and the related generated/custom visibilities. "
How do I model a plane frame that is inherently rigid and is hinged to the supports? ,For this it is recommended to use node shares. These enable the transfer of bending moments in the frame level as a transfer of normal and shear forces to the supports.The nodes to be released are the respective corner nodes with a moment hinge as a member end hinge. The released objects are the horizontal bars in the frame plane that connect to the corner nodes.
Do I have to add the reinforcement for ribs made of RF-CONCRETE Members and RF-CONCRETE Surfaces?,"It depends.In RF-CONCRETE surfaces, you have the option to ignore the portion of the internal forces that are taken into account in the rib design when designing in ULS and SLS (analytical). If this option has been activated, this can also be recognized accordingly in the course of the required reinforcement. See the following course of as,2,-z(above) for the ceiling with beam: In this case you would have to You add the results from RF-CONCRETE Surfaces and the results from RF-CONCRETE Members, since the rib portion of the surface internal forces in the direction of the beam in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces was not taken into account.If the option was not activated, then you would have to consider the maximum from the design in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces and RF-CONCRETE Members for the reinforcement design. "
How to create custom visibility?,"First you have to select the objects that should be included in the visibility. Then click on the ""Create new user-defined visibility"" button.

Is a compression reinforcement calculated in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces for a design in the ultimate limit state? Or is this only possible in RF-CONCRETE Members?,"Compression reinforcement is also calculated in RF-CONCRETE surfaces.The information that it is a ""compression reinforcement"" is displayed in the design details for the respective reinforcement layer."
I entered a line hinge within a surface. Does it make a difference whether the surface is subdivided at the line hinge or not? I noticed differences in results.,"It makes a difference whether the surface is subdivided or not.If the line on which the line hinge was placed is only integrated into the surface and the surface is not subdivided, then in RFEM -Solver uses a different approach - as opposed to a surface subdivided into patches.For a line that is merely integrated into a surface, the first row of elements is reduced in stiffness to approximate the line hinge. When approaching partial surfaces, the line hinge is realized internally by the solver using line releases, which means that the hinge can be mapped more precisely.The FE mesh should also be checked in this comparison . Depending on the geometry of the surfaces and the set FE mesh size, the FE mesh can deviate greatly, so that in addition to the different approaches in the calculation, deviations in the results can also result. In this case, the FE mesh can be approximated by FE mesh refinements."
Where can you define a wind speed diagram according to a specific wind standard for the numerical wind tunnel analysis in RWIND Simulation?,"In RWIND Simulation, the wind speed over the height of the wind tunnel inlet is organized in a table depending on the height coordinates and wind speeds. This table can be filled in RWIND manually or using specific function generators. If you do not create the model directly in RWIND Simulation, but instead transferred from RFEM or RSTAB to RWIND Simulation, the wind speed diagram can also be defined according to one of the available wind standards in the interface window:EN 1991-1-4 ASCE/SEI 7-16NBC 2015The wind speed diagram then results from the respective standard parameters (zone, terrain category, etc.)."
Where can I set the partial safety factors for the design in RF-CONCRETE Members?,"The partial safety factors for the reinforced concrete design can be edited in window 1.6 ""Reinforcement"" in the tab for the selected National Annex (e.g. DIN EN 1992-1-1). If desired, these values can also be reset to the default value. This also applies in a similar way to the add-on modules RF-CONCRETE Surfaces and RF-/CONCRETE Columns. "
How can I select staves that have a specific material?,"For the design of steel cross-sections, it is advisable to only select members that also have steel as the material.

"Why is the form-finding not working with the member type ""cable on disks""?","The member type ""cable on sheaves"" can only represent forces N and displacements ux in the direction of the cable. Therefore, it is not related to form finding, e.g. at the edge of membrane surfaces.See also the Section 4.17 in the online manual for RFEM 5. "
Which formula does the RF-/TOWER Load add-on module use to determine the first natural frequency for determining the structure coefficient?,"The first natural frequency is required to determine the structure coefficient. It is not determined with a generalized formula, but with the integrated eigenvalue solver RF-/DYNAM, taking into account the real mass distribution, and is output in column A of Table 2.3. "
Is it possible to enlarge the working window of the additional modules for a better overview?,"So far it has been possible to enlarge the working window for a few modules, including RF-FRAME CORNER Pro or the RF-MAST modules.

In the case of a purely linear calculation, the generation of result combinations can be defined in the basic model data. The attached video shows the automatic generation."
The dimensioning of a SHAPE-THIN profile is not possible due to an incorrect symmetry. What is the cause and how can I fix this?,"RF-/ALUMINUM checks the symmetry of general profiles and compares it with the SHAPE-THIN evaluation if the ""Determine symmetry by module and compare with SHAPE-THIN definition"" check box is activated.If the two methods deliver different results, an error message appears. There are often small inaccuracies in the SHAPE-THIN profile. The cross-section Sec-1.du9 is not absolutely symmetrical to the Z-axis: The Z-coordinates of nodes 1 and 4 as well as 55 and 60 do not match in the second decimal place.THIN-THIN classifies the profile as asymmetrical, but RF-/ALUMINIUM classifies it as monosymmetric to the z-axis.The SHAPE-THIN profile should be checked for symmetry. When modeling in SHAPE-THIN, it makes sense to only depict one side of the profile and create the other half by mirroring. This is also shown in the video."

"I would like to display the deformation of different load combinations with the same display factor, is this possible?","Yes, you can enter the display factor manually in the panel and lock it. As a result, this remains the same when changing between the load combinations."
How can I find the exact location of the notification that distorted FE elements were found? These areas cannot be discovered at first glance.,"If distorted elements are so small that they cannot be recognized, it is advisable to display the ""FE mesh quality annotations"". You can find this option in the Show Navigator → FE Mesh → FE Mesh Quality. There you can activate the comments for the ""Warning"" and ""Failure"" elements. You can immediately see where the spot is based on the values. With larger models it can be helpful to hide the model during the search."
Where can you see which user worked on the RFEM or RSTAB file?,"One option is the Windows property of the corresponding file. There you will find information on when and by whom the file was created or changed.You can get a detailed view in the ""History"" of the model, which can be called up via the project manager. This information can also be called up directly in RFEM or RSTAB in the general data. An automated retrieval of the data z. B. via a script is currently not possible."
"When creating the FE mesh for a solid, I get error #2306: ""The faces of the solid are not closed at the lines XX.""My volume has openings in the faces. How can I solve the problem?","A volume must always be perfectly closed. To illustrate the problem, imagine filling the volume with a liquid. No liquid should escape from the volume.The attached video shows how to easily and effectively insert the missing surfaces."
"When creating a material, I don't have nonlinear material models available for surfaces or solids. What is the reason?","Nonlinear material models are only available in the 3D environment. Please ensure that the model type is set to ""3D""."
How does the calculation of the moments of inertia differ if the cross-section consists of several unconnected or connected partial cross-sections?,"If the cross-section consists of several unconnected partial cross-sections, the sum of the moments of inertia is calculated without Steiner's components. The cross-section consists of two angle profiles that are not connected to each other. The individual angle profiles have the following moments of inertia:Iy,1,2 = 180.39 cm^4 (related to the centroids y, z)Iz,1, 2 = 65.05 cm^4 (in relation to the centroids y, z)The moments of inertia of the total cross-section are:Iy,1+2 = 2 ⋅ Iy,1,2 = 2 ⋅ 180.39 = 360.78 cm^4 (based on the centroids y, z)Iz,1+2 = 2 ⋅ Iz,1,2 = 2 ⋅ 65.05 = 130.11 cm^4 (based on the centroids y, z)If the cross-section consists of several connected partial cross-sections, the sum of the moments of inertia is formed with the Steiner components. The cross-section consists of two angle profiles connected to one another. The individual angle profiles have the following cross-section values:A1.2 = 16.25cm^2yS,0,1,2^ = ±2.30 cm (related to the zero point)zS,0.1.2^ = 3.07 cm (related to the zero point)Iy,1,2 = 180.39 cm^4 (based on the centroid axes y, z) Iz,1,2 = 65.05 cm^4 (based on the centroid axes y, z) The cross-section values of the total cross-section are:yS,0.1+2^ = 0.00 cm (based on the zero point)zS,0.1+2^ = 3.07 cm (related to the zero point)Iy,1+2 = 2 ⋅ Iy,1,2 + 2 ⋅ A1,2 ;⋅ (zS,0,1,2^ - zS,0,1+2)^2 Iy,1+2= 2 ⋅ 180.39 + 2 ⋅ 16.25⋅ (3.07 - 3.07)^ 2= 360.78 cm^4 (based on the centroids y, z)Iz,1+2 = 2 ⋅ Iz,1,2 + 2 ⋅ A1,2 ⋅ (yS,0,1,2^ - yS,0,1+2)^2Iz,1 +2 = 2 ⋅ 65.05 + 2 ⋅ 16.25 ⋅ (2.30 - 0.00)^2 = 301.46 cm^4 (in relation to the centroids y, z)"
Is it also possible to check punching shear on vertical walls?,"Yes, punching shear verifications for vertical walls are also possible.Please note, however, that this feature was not available in the first versions of RF-PUNCH Pro. You need RFEM 5.08 or newer for this."
How do you transform the properties of elasticity and shear modulus of a membrane fabric with the usual force/length syntax into the general force/area syntax for input in RFEM?,"The thickness of membranes is usually very thin compared to the surface area. Due to these extreme geometric conditions, the stiffness of membrane fabrics is usually related directly to a strip width, ie line (cf. line spring), without considering the thickness. In contrast to this, the general FEM program RFEM processes material definitions (E, G, ν, etc.) and surface properties (shell, membrane, etc.) independently of each other. With the pure definition of the material it is therefore still unclear whether it is e.g. B. is a rigid plate structure or a tension-loaded limp membrane structure. The final element specification only results from the additional consideration of the surface properties for the simulation. For this reason, RFEM always requires the stiffness description in the general unit syntax force/area, independent of the geometric conditions of the component to be simulated. The line-related membrane stiffness in the syntax force/length can can thus be converted into the syntax force/area in RFEM by considering a reference thickness d: $\frac{\mathrm F}{ \mathrm A}=\frac{\left({\displaystyle\frac{\mathrm F}{\mathrm L}}\right)}{\mathrm d}$ withF ... forceL ... lengthd ... reference thicknessA . .. Area The thus transformed stiffness in the force/area format is related to the reference thickness used and can be specified in RFEM by specifying the reference thickness d as membrane surface thickness Translate membrane stiffness in force/length format.

Where is the setting for displaying the axis system in the graphics window?,You can find this setting in the Show navigator. 
Can I manually enter the load for the punching analysis in RF-PUNCH Pro?,"Yes, this is possible in the ""1.5 Punching node"" mask. This can be used, for example, if the determination of the punching load is based on the smoothed or non-smoothed course of the lateral forces in the critical perimeter is negatively influenced by singularities."
"Why can I specify a ""creeping permanent load"" in RF-CONCRETE Columns and not in RF-CONCRETE Members?","The add-on module RF-CONCRETE Columns offers the possibility to define a ""creeping permanent load"". You will find a corresponding tab for this in the ""1.1 General data"" mask. The background to the input is that RF-CONCRETE Columns use this ""creeping permanent load"" for automatic determination of the effective creep coefficient according to EN 1992-1-1, 5.8.4.In contrast to this, in RF-CONCRETE Members you will not find an explicit input option for this creep-generating permanent load. In RF-CONCRETE Members, no automatic reduction of the effective creep coefficient is carried out for a stability analysis of reinforced concrete columns using a nonlinear design. Background information on the effective creep coefficient applied in RF-CONCRETE members can also be found in Manual for RF-CONCRETE Members in section 2.4.6.The same applies to the RSTAB add-on modules CONCRETE Columns or CONCRETE."
"would like to dimension a suspension crane with the CRANEWAY add-on module. Where are the design points 0, 1 and 2 for the stress analysis at the bottom flange and for the fatigue analysis?","The design points in CRANEWAY were adopted according to the standard. The stresses are calculated for the following points: Design point 0 Cut of the flange at the edge of the web or at the start of the fillet Design point 1 Flange at the load application point (this can be checked as wheel spacing in window 1.4) Design point 2 Flange edgeThese points are not displayed more precisely in the graphics of the cross-section in the CRANEWAY program. However, at the design points 0 and 2 there is always a stress point for which result values can also be output directly."
Is a boundary layer model used in RWIND Simulation?,"In RWIND Simulation, each model surface standing in the wind flow is treated as a ""smooth"" wall. As of RWIND Simulation Version 1.26, it is possible to define roughness parameters. With this definition, there is a boundary layer in the areas around which the air flows near the walls, which, depending on the air viscosity, has an influence on the velocity profile perpendicular to the wall. This boundary layer is implemented in RWIND Simulation according to the so-called ""law of the wall"". This law describes the velocity profile perpendicular to the wall and can be represented using the dimensionless variables u^+ and y^+ . Dimensionless variable u^+:$\mathrm u ^+=\frac{\mathrm U}{{\mathrm u}_{\mathrm \tau}}$withU ... velocity at the walluτ ... Friction speed Dimensionless variable y^+:$\mathrm y^+=\frac{{\mathrm u}_{\mathrm\tau}\cdot \mathrm y}{\mathrm\nu}$withy .. Wall distanceuτ ... Friction velocity ν ...

The remaining part of the boundary layer results from the solution of the globally applied Navier-Stokes equations. "
The attempt to print full window shows that there would actually be much more space in the log for the graphic. Can this be changed?,"Sometimes it is not possible to print larger graphics because the lighting of the system is controlled by a box in the background. As a result, you will unfortunately lose some space in the log."
How can I influence the wind load distribution on the sides of the mast in the RF-/TOWER Load add-on module?,"A user-defined wind load distribution is not provided within the Eurocode. In order to implement a user-defined wind load distribution within the RF-/TOWER Load add-on module, this can only be done after switching to DIN, for example DIN 4131:1993-11, mask ""1.3 Wind load - Part 1"". A user-defined distribution can then be selected in the ""1.4 Wind load - Part 2"" mask and defined in the adjacent table. "
Why is an imperfection always displayed graphically with the displacement at the column base?,"Imperfections are always aligned to a bearing in the graphic.The only support of the imperfection is defined at the column head. Therefore, the imperfection is aligned at this point. Since the graphic imperfection is in fact an equivalent load, the representation in this case is only of visual relevance. The display is not important for the calculation. In order to graphically align the imperfection with the upper column head, you could use a rigid member and the support there, for example arrange."

It opens up access to further selection criteria such as e.g. For example, for member section sizes, the selection of only the extreme values or the node values and the extreme values."
"have provided a spatial model with a strict numbering of the objects. However, the ""Visibility by numbering"" function only allows me to display either surfaces or members by their numbering. How can I display both the bars 50 to 70 and the faces numbered in the same range in one visibility?",It should work with the Select special → Add function.Attached is a short video explaining the exact procedure.
"For the member loads, the loads are entered in table ""3.2 Member loads"". I can view or change the values.In my model, I have applied generated loads. Shouldn't the member loads also be visible in the ""3.15 Generated loads"" table?","The load values of generated loads are stored in table ""3.15 Generated Loads"". It is not possible to make changes there.If you want to change the loads, you must separate the generated loads. You can do this quickly via the Last context menu."
"I manually defined a snow load of 5 kN/m^2 in the RX-TIMBER program. However, a load of 4 kN/m^2 is used in the calculation. Why isn't the defined snow load applied?","According to EN 1991-1-3, the snow load must be multiplied by the factor 0.8 for snow load on the roof. This results in the following load:sk =5 kN/m^2 x 0.8 = 4 kN/m^2 If the load has already been calculated for the roof, the load can also be entered under user-defined loads."
How can I change or parameterize the radius of a circle line?,"The radius of a circle can be changed by opening the ""Edit line"" window and adjusting the radius. Clicking on the button next to the input field of the value opens the context menu , you can also define formulas for determining the radius."
What is the difference between the add-on modules RF-/FUND and RF-/FUND Pro?,"RF-/FUND Pro is the further development of the RF-/FUND module.The main differences are as follows:Design according to Eurocode instead of DIN Additional type of foundation ""Block foundation with smooth inner sides"": Entering a soil profile and calculation of settlement: "
How can I simulate friction between the floor slab and the subsoil without having to enter a contact volume?,"When entering a surface foundation, a non-linearity can be set for the spring stiffness in the direction of the local z-axis. For example, ""Failure if contact stress is negative"". In the nonlinearity detail settings (button to the right of the nonlinearity selection), the option ""Friction in plane xy"". A coefficient of friction can also be entered there. "

have defined a nonlinear line support with dropout. Implausible results are shown to me when evaluating the results. What can I do?,"Similar to the surfaces, there are various smoothing options for displaying the results of the support reactions. With a non-linear bearing, you should always select the actual history to display the results. "
I can't properly graph a variable polygon load on a face. It is not really apparent what load is actually applied. Is there an optional display option for this?,"There is an option for this in the RFEM 5 results navigator.After calculating a load case or a COC, you can switch to the results navigator and select the ""Load distribution"" result type there. This allows the load applied to the respective element to be displayed. This can also be used very well for graphical documentation of the load and printed as a graphic in the log. "
Is it possible to transfer only a specific selection of elements to the RWIND Simulation wind tunnel?,"Yes, the ""Simulate and generate wind loads"" interface application controls which objects are to be transferred to the RWIND Simulation wind tunnel with the ""Export only active objects"" option under the ""Settings"" tab. If the option ""Only export active objects"" is not activated, all objects available in the model are placed in the wind tunnel. In the other case, the program only moves the objects in the currently displayed visibility of the model into the wind tunnel. The other hidden objects are then ignored."
Where can older program versions of the Dlubal programs be downloaded?,"Older program versions can be downloaded from the Dlubal website under the menu item ""Support and Training"". You can find the direct link below this FAQ."
Is it possible to apply the minimum moments according to DIN EN 1992-1-1 in RF-PUNCH Pro?,"Yes. This is possible in input dialog 1.5. If too few nodes were selected for the design, so that the program calculates the dimensions lx or .ly according to DIN EN 1992-1-1, 6.4.5 (NA6), cannot be determined automatically, you receive the message that the prerequisites for determining the minimum moments are not met are met.The program requires at least 4 nodes so that the spans in x and y direction can be determinedIn this case, the minimum moments can be defined manually. "
Can I also transfer loads and load cases via the .stp interface (regulated according to DSTV)?,"Yes, that is possible. Usually, only individual members of a large system are exported for this purpose in order to carry out detailed investigations on these objects. For this export, see another FAQ more hints (see link below). The export of a member with loads is shown in the attached video."
"Why do I get the message 28) in RF-CONCRETE Members, after which I have to carry out a ""standard case design"" with internal forces according to the first-order theory?","RF-CONCRETE Columns determines an equivalent moment M0e from the moment M02 at the column head and M01 at the column base according to EN 1992- 1-1, 5.8.8.2(2) and carries out the design with this equivalent moment M0e according to the model column method.Now it can be that e.g. B. purely from the cross-section verification with the moment M01 at the column head, a mathematically larger required reinforcement cross-section would result.To ensure this, the message 28) is output, after which the user with should carry out a standard design based on internal forces according to the first-order theory. To do this, you can simply open the RF-CONCRETE Members module and design the member designed in RF-CONCRETE Columns based purely on the internal forces according to the first-order theory."
"When importing a .stp (DSTV) file that I exported to RFEM/RSTAB, I get the error message shown in the picture. No cross sections are exported. Why is that?","In order to carry out an import into RFEM/RSTAB via the DSTV interface, the program needs nodes at which the cross-sections can be localized. The ""Only export selected objects"" option is often only members are selected in the model. In this case, the nodes are missing from the selection. The model cannot be created. All objects that are required to describe the model should therefore be selected using the ""Select"" → ""Objects that belong together"" option. Then the import will be carried out correctly."
Why does the material parameter in the program differ from the material parameter in the current standard?,"This is because in the program you have the option of selecting materials from both valid and old (""invalid"") series of standards.The materials are stored in the program with a material designation and a standard . When selecting the desired material, the material designation and the standard must be observed in order to make the correct choice."

Can I also use the horizontal branch of the stress-strain curve when designing cross-sections in RF-CONCRETE Members?,"RF-CONCRETE Members or CONCRETE calculates a cross-section check with the stress-strain curve for reinforcing steel according to DIN EN 1992-1-1, 3.2.7(2)a - i.e. with an increasing upper branch up to ftk and a strain limit of εud = 0.025. In RF-CONCRETE Members or CONCRETE there is no option with which one could switch to a design with a horizontal branch according to 3.2.7(2)b.However, it may be possible to calculate with a user-defined material in which ftk = fyk is equated."
According to which set of rules or according to which standard is the composite beam designed with the VERBUND-TR 8.xx program?,"The VERBUND-TR program enables the verification of composite beams according to the preliminary standard ENV 1994-1-1:1992:10.For the time being, it is only the preliminary standard implemented. A design according to EN 1994-1-1 is currently not possible.See also the performance description on the product homepage for VERBUND-TR via the following link."
"I have a node that is subjected to a concentrated load, but I cannot select it for design in RF-PUNCH Pro. Why?","In RF-PUNCH Pro, nodes can be selected for the design, to which a concentrated load acts as a ""node load"". Important: Free concentrated loads cannot be applied here, since the position of the free concentrated loads is not defined via a node, but via their coordinates.The nodes that are subjected to a nodal load , can only be picked once a load has been selected for design."
How do I activate or start RF-/STEEL Cold-Formed Sections?,"RF-/STEEL Cold-Formed Sections is a module extension of RF-/STEEL EC3. In the detailed settings of RF-/STEEL EC3, only the check for cold-formed sections needs to be activated. "
"Is there a way to add an index (e.g. ""a"") to the page numbering in the printout report?","The details of the printhead, which is created during the installation from the customer data, can be changed in the printout report via the menu Settings → Report header or the assigned button in the toolbar of the printout report.If, for example, for ""Page"" the standard numbers are set and the control field is ticked, the individual pages are managed consecutively.The ""Details"" button allows detailed specifications for the numbering in a new dialog.

"In RF-/STEEL Cold-Formed Sections, I want to design a section that is not contained in the RFEM/RSTAB cross-section library. What should I do?","General cold-formed profiles can be modeled with THIN-THIN. In the general information, first activate the ""c/t parts and effective cross-section values"" check box. Then, in the ""c /t-parts and effective cross-section"" of the calculation parameters dialog, select the option ""EN 1993-1-3 (cold-formed profile)"".The values specified in EN 1993-1-3 [1], 5.2 for the applicability of the standard can optionally be checked. To do this, the corresponding checkboxes must be activated. If the geometric conditions are not met, an error message is displayed before the calculation. The elements of the profile must be entered first. The nominal values of the straight widths are usually generated automatically from the geometry constraints, but can also be user-defined in table ""1.7 Nominal values of straight widths after 1993-1-3"" or the corresponding dialog. The buckling stiffeners can then be defined in the table ""1.8 buckling stiffeners"" or in the corresponding dialog. Furthermore, the buckling field must be specified in table ""1.9 buckling fields"" or in the dialog. To do this, the elements of the buckling field must be selected. The stiffeners in the buckling panel are recognized automatically. For the design of the cold-formed section in RF-/STEEL Cold-Formed Sections, it is sufficient that the buckling stiffeners and buckling panels of the profile are defined. The effective cross-section does not have to be additionally calculated in SHAPE-THIN. The calculation can then be started and the warning message confirmed with ""OK"". After saving the calculated profile, it can be saved in RFEM or RSTAB be read."
What is the difference in the material model nonlinear elastic and nonlinear plastic 2D/3D?,"In this earlier post, the isotropic nonlinear elastic material model was explained in detail. In contrast to this, in the material model Isotropically plastic, when the plastic material properties are reached, the total strain ε is divided into an elastic and plastic component. ε=εel+εpl In the attached example, both material models are combined on an identical cantilever with identical loads compared. The load was increased using the Incremental load increase function up to a deformation of 40cm. The Incremental load increase function is explained in the following entry ."
"When rotating the view, it appears as if the X and Y coordinates are swapped. Is there a display problem here?","The effect described is not a display error, just a matter of perspective and a good example of the optical illusion. It depends on whether you perceive the representation of the axis system as an inside or outside corner.Example Rubik's Cube in isometric viewThe yellow side of the cube is the upper surface. In the default isometric view, you look at the inside corner of the coordinate system from an angle above. If you simply turn the view upside down so that Z is pointing up, X is pointing to the right and Y is pointing to the left, you are looking at the underside of the cube, i.e. from above at the lower outer corner of the coordinate system. If you now rotate the view by about 45° around the horizontal axis, you may get the impression that you are looking at the inner corner of the coordinate system again. However, this is the outside corner."
How do I create a user-defined material in the RX-TIMBER program?,"user-defined material can be created in RX-TIMBER as a new material in the material database as in the programs RFEM/RSTAB. In contrast to RFEM/RSTAB, the material category fixed to ""Wood""."

Depending on the standard selected in dialog 1.1, various options are available here. The option applies to RF-CONCRETE Members (RFEM 5) and CONCRETE (RSTAB 8)."
Can a spherically curved glass pane be designed in RF-GLASS?,"Yes, this is possible.When modeling a spherically curved pane of glass, make sure that the surface consists of only four boundary lines. p>In RF-GLASS, the ""Enable layered mesh for solids"" option must be deactivated for double-curved or spherical glass panes. More information on curved surfaces in RF-GLASS can be found in another FAQ (see link below)."
Why is an opening not taken into account when determining the punching shear load from the shear forces in the critical perimeter?,"When determining the punching load from the shear forces in the critical perimeter, an uninterrupted perimeter is used.If an interrupted perimeter were used when determining the punching load, a load component (over the interrupted length) remain unconsidered. This would be the case, for example, if you only defined the opening in RF-PUNCH Pro, but not in the RFEM model. In the RFEM model, the shear force would develop over the uninterrupted cross-section. If the proportion were neglected, the punching load would be determined too low.For this reason, an uninterrupted perimeter is always used in RF-PUNCH Pro when determining the punching load from the shear forces within the critical perimeter.In the verification (on the resistance side), the opening is then taken into account again and the circumference of the perimeter is reduced accordingly."
How can I quickly model a chimney with reinforcement rings and stiffeners?,"In RFEM, the easiest way is to use the ""Flat surface"" → ""Ring"" function. This allows the reinforcement rings to be modeled very quickly and conveniently. Then you can extrude the inner line into a surface, and the chimney is already generated. Now the existing ring surface is copied upwards and corresponding stiffeners are modeled. The stiffeners can be distributed over the circumference of the chimney with the ""Rotate"" command. The lines of the reinforcement ring must then be integrated into the quadrangle surface of the chimney. Otherwise the elements are not connected."
Can I carry out a fire protection analysis for cross laminated timber panels with RF-LAMINATE?,"The fire protection analysis is not implemented in the RF-LAMINATE module by default. However, it is possible to calculate the charring rates yourself and to take them into account accordingly in the module. This is explained using a simple plate in the following example. System : Span width 5mSlab width 2mLF1 (permanent) 1kN/m² plus own weightLF2 (medium) 2.5kN/m² 3 layersS1 35mm C24S2 20mm C24S3 35mm C24Information regarding the correction factors and stiffness can be found in the attached file. Fire protection factors: Combustion rate ß0=0.65mm/minPyrolysis zone k0d0=7mmCombustion time t=30minEffective thickness def=t ß0+k0d0=30min x 0.65mm/min+7mm=26.5mmResidual thickness layer 3= 35-26.5=8.5mm> 3mm => Thickness can be set. Due to the changed layer thicknesses, a new stiffness matrix results, which is used in RFEM for the extraordinary combinations with characteristic stiffness values. Design values are used for the ultimate limit state."
"After dividing a column with intermediate nodes, I get different results than before in the add-on module RF-/CONCRETE Columns. What can be the reason?","The reason for the different results is probably due to the buckling length settings for the stability check. According to the default setting, these are automatically determined in the add-on module RF-/CONCRETE Columns. However, this procedure does not work for separate members and no stability analysis is carried out (a corresponding warning message appears). If the buckling lengths were entered manually, this only applies to the individual member. In order to be able to carry out a correct stability analysis for the column as a whole component, it must be defined as a set of members. "
"Is it possible with RF-LAMINATE to carry out a detailed analysis of connections, supports or reinforcements of cross laminated timber panels?","In principle, detailed analyzes can also be carried out with RF-LAMINATE. For example, if the shear distortion is very high, it can make sense to carry out the modeling using orthotropic volumes. The video shows the simple modeling and evaluation of the results of a layer structure using volume.One criterion for when modeling using volume makes sense is the shear correction factor. Further information on this and other criteria can be found in the following FAQs:Thrust correction factorNetworkShear distortion"
How can I account for the compliance of a continuous beam with slotted dowel connections?,"The easiest way to take this into account is to use the RF-/JOINTS Timber Steel to Timber module. To do this, the module dissolves the original connection and creates a new static system that takes account of the resilience accordingly. The consideration is made separately for load capacity, serviceability and exceptional. "
"I have set a variable load profile for a generated load. This should be applied step by step in a certain direction. However, the load is not stepped, but displayed with a linear progression. How can the load be represented correctly?","In order for the load to be displayed correctly, some adjustments are required. In the case of a load applied in stages, the area load level may only be demarcated in sections (per load stage). Otherwise the load is distributed linearly over the entire area load plane."
Why does the section force table for some members give intermediate results exactly at the member end nodes?,"The output of the intermediate values is generally linked to the member division property. In addition, member loads defined in sections in RFEM generate additional intermediate results. For example, if the member load defined in sections runs from the beginning of the member to the end of the member, intermediate results are obtained at the member end nodes. "
Where can I set the Poisson's ratio?,The Poisson's ratio is set in the material via Edit material.
There is a display option for the internal force VL when displaying the result curves on the member (type 'rib'). What is this value and how is it calculated?,"The force VL represents a longitudinal shear force between the top surface and the bar. It is calculated as an integrated shear flow between the plate and the bar at a given point on the bar. For the simplified example in the appendix, the cross-section values are as follows with an integration width of 10 cm: $I_y=\ frac{b\times h^3}{12}=\frac{10 cm\times20 cm^3}{12}=6666.67 cm^4$$S_y=h_1\times b\ times((h-e_z)-\frac{h_2}2)=10 cm\times10 cm\times((20 cm-10 cm)-\frac{10 cm}2)=500 cm^3$ $\tau=V_L=\frac{V_z\times S_y}{I_y\times b}=\frac{5.53 kN\times500 cm^3}{6666.67 cm^4}=0.415 kN/cm =41.5 kN/m$The integration width was set to a total of 10 cm.

Problems arise when generating the FE mesh of an ETFE cushion. I can not find the error. What can I do?,"Most of the time, the problem is that the finite elements of the top surfaces are very close to each other at the edge of the pillow when Bezier surfaces are used. The FE mesh nodes of the bottom and top surfaces may then be merged. There are basically two approaches here: 1. Fix the problem numerically: You can adjust the tolerance for FE mesh node merging via the Tools menu → Regenerate Model. 2. Solving the problem geometrically: The more practical solution is to increase the distance between faces with edge faces"

I am designing a mixed structure of wood materials with different creep properties. How can the design be carried out with regard to the serviceability according to EN 1995-1-1?,"The simplified designs from [1] Chapter 2.2.3 have been implemented in RFEM and RSTAB for the automatic load combinatorics. This means that, strictly speaking, only structures in which materials with identical creep behavior occur can be analyzed with regard to the final deformation, since the creep deformations are taken into account in a simplified manner on the load side. If the structure is a mixed structure made of wood with different creep properties or in combination with steel, the end deformations must be calculated according to [2] change to 2.2.3 as be determined as follows:""(4) If a structure consists of parts or components with different creep properties, the long-term deformations due to the quasi-permanent combination of actions should be calculated with the final values of the mean values of the corresponding elasticity , shear and displacement moduli can be calculated according to 2.3.2.2(1). The final deformation ufin is then calculated by superimposing the initial deformation due to the difference between the characteristic and the quasi-permanent combinations of actions with the long-term deformation.""However, this sets an overlay of results from different load combinations, which cannot be implemented automatically in RFEM and RSTAB. If the different creep properties are to be taken into account, the load combinatorics must be created manually and the stiffness reduced according to the creep coefficient. The procedure is shown using the example of a wood-concrete composite floor, which was presented at the 2017 Info Day. The link for this can be found below this FAQ."

After pressing OK you are automatically taken to mask 1.3. Please select further meshes and/or reinforcing bars here and then carry out the design again.
"Does it make a difference if I model a coplanar beam as a ""rib"" or as a ""result beam""?","Yes, this has an impact on the stiffness of the overall system.If you enter a coplanar beam as ""rib"", add the stiffness of the defined rectangular cross-section in the line area. On the other hand, you only define the integration width for the result member. The entered rectangular cross-section has no influence on the stiffness of the entire system, but is only applied as a design cross-section in the add-on modules (e.g. RF-CONCRETE Members)."
I want to model a threaded rod as a 3D solid in RFEM. Is this possible?,"A thread cannot be created in the program using a function. Here you have to generate this geometrically using nodes and lines. In the program there is the option to create the windings using trajectory surfaces. However, you have the option of using copying and rotating to achieve your goal fairly quickly."
get undesignability in RF-CONCRETE surfaces with the information that the shear resistance cannot be verified (cross-section completely cracked). What is the background to this message?,"The non-designability is then output if the shear force resistance without shear force reinforcement VRd,c is calculated less than zero. A value for VRd,c less than zero is caused by large tensile normal forces. In this context, the cross-section is completely under tension or is completely cracked and no shear force resistance can be built up. The following situation arises for covered cross-sections with planned shear force reinforcement: In RF-CONCRETE surfaces, if VRd,c < 0, no further shear force analysis is performed and message 13) is output. This approach is conservative. There was a request (194) for the interpretation of the standard, which allows the use of the truss model even with a completely cracked cross-section. If a shear force reinforcement is planned, the message about non-designability in the program can be ignored. In this case it should be ensured that VEd is smaller than VRd,max and VRd,s."
"When opening an RSTAB 8 file including scissor hinges in RFEM 5, I get an error message stating that the scissor hinges could not be imported correctly. What can be the reason?","Please check the definition of the scissor hinges in the RSTAB 8 file.So that the function of the scissor hinge can be properly considered, the ends of the two members that ""touch"" at a node must , the scissors joint of the same type must be specified. If this is not the case, you will receive the error message described. If this error message was displayed when you opened an RSTAB 8 file in RFEM 5, it may be lead to problems in the calculation, e.g. B. to the effect that the structure becomes unstable due to an incorrect release definition (already in RSTAB 8).The problem should therefore be adjusted either in the RSTAB 8 file or in the RFEM model after the import."
Can the isosurface display also be displayed in one color or transparently?,"In order to display the isosurface representation of the results in one color, the color scale must be edited. To do this, simply double-click on the color scale or edit the color scale with the right mouse button. The slider can then be pushed down so far that only one color remains. You can change the color by double-clicking on it. The maximum value can then be entered manually in the penultimate input field. If a colorless display is desired, a very small number must be defined for the penultimate value. It is also advisable to activate the ""Outlines of deformed surfaces"" option."
Can I also connect a rib bar to two surfaces with different thicknesses? And where can I check the cross-section properties of this composite cross-section? In RFEM I only see the eccentric rectangular cross-section and its cross-section properties.,"You can connect a ribbed member to a line on two surfaces with different thicknesses.To determine the stiffness or internal forces, in RFEM the eccentricity for the rectangular cross-section is calculated using the mean value of the two connected surfaces determined. For the design in RF-CONCRETE Members, the add-on module determines a separate cross-section, which is displayed in the add-on module in the ""1.4 Ribs"" input dialog. By clicking on the ""i"" button, an info dialog for the generated rib cross-section can be opened, in which all cross-section values, the position of the Shear center and center of gravity, etc., which are applied for the design in the module. If the ""effective width"" in dialog ""1.4 Ribs"" (e.g. to 0.50 m), this affects the cross-section applied in RF-CONCRETE Members and its cross-section properties. However, this has no influence on the stiffness or the determination of internal forces in the 3D model in RFEM."
How can you influence in RF-LOAD-HISTORY whether the deformations of the individual load levels are either determined separately in each load level or whether they are added?,"This setting can be made in the RF-LOAD-HISTORY add-on module under ""Details"" → ""Options"" → ""Deformation type"".The deformation type ""In specific load level"" shows the deformations of each shows each load level separately, the deformation type ""On non-deformed structure"" shows the sum of all load levels."

Can line approvals be copied?,"Yes, that is possible. Simply select the structure to be copied. Make sure that the line releases and all released objects are also selected. Now you can create a copy with the ""Move and Copy"" function."
Are there facade surfaces in RFEM for transferring the wind loads to the primary structure?,"In RFEM there are no special facade surfaces for the distribution of wind loads. However, such a load distribution element without influencing the load-bearing capacity of the primary structure can be generated using the standard RFEM tools. To do this, proceed as follows: Define an isotropically linearly elastic ""Facade Material"" with the average stiffness of the adjacent primary structural elements without specific weight, thermal expansion property and stiffness modification. In the facade areas, describe surfaces made of the facade material with the stiffness type ""Orthotrop "". The thickness and torsional stiffness should be defined as zero so that no opposing load is transferred to the primary structure at the surface corners. We recommend using the average thickness of the adjacent primary structural elements / 1000 as the thickness and dividing the related torsional stiffness k33 by a factor of 1000. Define a line release between the facade surfaces and the primary structural elements so that only forces perpendicular to the primary structural elements can be transferred. All other directions are to be specified force-free. So that the surfaces released with the line releases do not slip in the wall plane, the facade surfaces to place a surface support in the plane degrees of freedom x and y. With this option, you can distribute pressure loads acting perpendicular to the facade surfaces and wind pressures from the RWIND simulation calculation to the primary structure. It should be noted that this facade surface modeling must be used in conjunction with a linear calculation theory. "

"When entering surface loads, you can enter a correction factor to take into account the effect of throughput. For the outer members or supports of a continuous beam, the factor 0.8 is entered in the model, which I took over from a colleague. Shouldn't the factor for an outfield be 0.4?","In the example below, the loads are distributed linearly depending on the distance between the bars, without taking into account the respective throughput effect. Correction factors are used to take these into account. To assign the load correction factors to the members, select the members on which the load is to be corrected. For the edge members, the load correction factor is 0.8, since the loading of the members is internal to the program is automatically halved at the edge (with the same spans). Force values according to the table for a continuous beam with five spans: A = 0.395 B = 1.132 0.395 / 0.5 = 0.8 --> If you were to calculate with a factor of 0.4, the load would be wrong. The bars in field 1 are corrected to 1.1. After pressing [OK], the load will be adjusted automatically."
Is it possible to dynamically analyze an initial deflection of a component with RFEM or RSTAB? ,"Yes, this is possible with the add-on module RF-/DYNAM Pro - Forced Vibrations. The time histories can be used for this application. This is available for both solution methods (linear Newmark analysis or modal analysis), but the procedures are slightly different.The procedure is as follows:Define a load case, which contains a load that causes the desired initial deflection.Activate the time history analysis of the time diagrams in RF-/DYNAM Pro and define a new time diagram that has a multiplier of 0 over the entire time. In the dynamic load cases, select the defined time diagram (which load case you combine it with is irrelevant, since it multiplies the load by 0). You can then import the load case defined in the first step as the initial condition (or only the initial deformation in the modal analysis). Thus, the conditions from this load case are read in at time t=0 and released immediately afterwards. With this procedure, you can detect a vibration after an initial deflection simulate. For clarification, an example file can be found in the download area, in which this method is shown on a single-mass oscillator."
"What does the setting ""Approach of centric restraint"", ""Approach of constraint to bend"" or ""Depending on defined load"" do when determining the minimum reinforcement As,min from restraint?","The selection in the ""1.3 Surfaces"" input dialog in the ""Crack width limitation"" tab has a direct influence on the kc coefficient for the analytical calculation of the minimum reinforcement As,min for inclusion of constraint stresses according to Equation (7.1) according to DIN EN 1992-1-1, 7.3.2. If ""centric constraint"" is selected, a kc value = 1.0 applied. If ""Bending constraint"" is used, the module sets the kc coefficient strictly to 0.4. If ""Depending on defined Load"" is selected, the program interpolates the kc value element by element depending on the stress distribution in the cross section based on the defined load. This means that when you select ""Centric constraint"" or ""Bending constraint"", a constant progression of the minimum reinforcement from constraint is determined for the respective reinforcement direction of the area becomes. If you select ""Depending on defined loads"", the minimum reinforcement from restraint does not have a constant curve. The program behavior described above is in RF-CONCRETE Members and RF -CONCRETE surfaces (in RFEM 5) are identical and basically also applies to the add-on module CONCRETE (in RSTAB 8)."
"According to DIN EN 1995-1-1/NA, the crack factor kcr may be increased by 30% for softwood in areas that are at least 1.50 m away from the end grain of the wood. How can this be implemented in RF-/TIMBER Pro?","The increase of the crack factor kcr currently still has to be done manually, since the program does not know where the end-grain end is defined. To do this, the bar must be divided 1.5 m from the end of the end grain so that the affected areas can be designed as a separate bar. Two design cases are now required (File → New case ...). In case 1, members are selected for design that lie within these 1.5 m. In case 2, the members are selected for which the 30% should be taken into account. Then, in case 2, the kcr value is adjusted manually in the settings for the national annex. This results in a kcr of 0.65 for C24. Thus, the dimensioning takes place with an increased kcr value."

How to read a parameterized cross-section series into the cross-section library?,"The cross-section library in RFEM or RSTAB allows you to import a list of parameterized cross-sections into the user-defined cross-section library with the ""Import cross-section series from file"" function. For this task, the cross-section shape to be imported must be compatible with a shape that can already be parameterized in the Dlubal cross-section library (also called a cross-section series). This cross-section shape then determines the type and order of the import parameters. To import a user-defined cross-section series, proceed as follows: In the Dlubal cross-section library, search for a cross-section series that is compatible with the cross-section series to be imported. Enter here the parameterizable cross-section types (thin-walled, solid and timber construction) directly in your input dialog via the input boxes from top to bottom the necessary parameters in the correct order for the import. Find for rolled cross-section types Enter the necessary parameters in the correct order using the ""Parametric input"" function. Create a CSV table for the cross-section series to be imported , which describes a clear cross-section in each line using the parameters ""Name"" + shape parameters using the previously defined parameter list and order. The shape parameters must be specified in the unit mm For reasons of data representation, the individual cross-section names in the CSV file should start with the same text fragment as the CSV file name itself. This ensures that the new cross-section series in RFEM or RSTAB has the same name as the CSV file. Import the CSV file into the user-defined cross-section library, specifying the cross-section series used . Use the cross sections of the newly imported cross section series in your models. "

have modeled a reinforced concrete column as a solid and I want to perform a punching analysis for the connection of the column to the floor. Is that possible with RF-PUNCH Pro?,"For the punching analysis, RF-PUNCH Pro requires a node on a column from which the axial force of the column can be taken for the analysis. If you have mapped the column as a solid (e.g . with a rectangular cross-section) and this volume is directly connected to the slab, then you cannot use this situation in RF-PUNCH Pro for the design. The bar section size is missing because only one volume is used. You can, however, add a short connecting rod (e.g. rigid rod) to the end of the solid. Then the rigid member can be connected to the floor at an end node and the axial force in the coupling bar can be used for the punching analysis. Please note that the dimensions of the coupling bar or rigid members do not have to be defined in the RFEM model. Therefore, standard dimensions for the column cross-section are used in RF-PUNCH Pro."

How do I create neighboring building and terrain models for the numerical flow simulation in RWIND Simulation?,"In addition to the building to be analyzed, the RWIND Simulation program also allows neighboring buildings and the surrounding landform to be taken into account in the numerical wind tunnel. To do this, the program provides the ""Import model from file"" function under the ""Insert"" menu. With this import function, RFEM or RSTAB models can be imported via the * .vtp ParaView format as well as pure building and terrain geometries can be imported into the RWIND simulation environment via the *.ifc Industry Foundation Classes 2x3 format and the *.stl stereolithography format. The imported models are organized separately next to the main model in the numerical wind tunnel. An overview of the imported models is shown in the project navigator under the ""Model"" arm. The additionally imported models can be specified in the properties under model type as a secondary model or as a terrain shape. Depending on the setting, the additional model then receives the boundary conditions of a wind-blown body (similar to the primary model) or a ground surface. At the end of the calculation, the program outputs the wind flow and resulting surface pressures on the main model and all secondary additional models. The *.vtp format is currently only used internally to exchange data between RWIND Simulation and RFEM or RSTAB. Your choice If no suitable format is available for the neighboring and terrain models, you can use the RFEM or RSTAB model export function in RWIND Simulation to create a corresponding *.stl model. To do this, proceed as follows: Save the model to be analyzed under a new name. Create the desired neighboring or terrain model in the copied model in relation to the model being analyzed using member, surface and volume elements. Delete the primary model to be analyzed , so that only the neighboring or terrain model remains in the area Open the RWIND Simulation interface menu ""Simulate and generate wind loads"" Put the focus on the 1st line in the ""Load Cases"" tab and use the ""Open in RWIND Simulation"" function to move the neighboring model into the wind tunnel. Click with the Right-click the additional model in RWIND Simulation and select the ""Export selected models"" function Confirm the export of the original neighboring model with ""Yes"" in the control prompt and save the corresponding *.stl Model from.

I have the problem that some bars in my sets of bars are twisted. Why is this and how can I solve it? ,"A slight deviation in the node coordinates can lead to a twisting of the member orientation. You can check this in the future by getting information about the position of the rod in space from table column N. You can read there to which global axis the member is parallel or in which plane spanned by the global axes the member lies. If there is no entry, the member is in any position in space. "
curved pane cannot be designed in RF-GLASS. Why?,"When modeling a glass pane, in particular an insulating glass pane, in RFEM it is important to ensure that the boundary lines only consist of four lines. A subdivision of the lines should be avoided if possible, since then the calculation can no longer be carried out. A corresponding warning message is issued before the calculation.If special intermediate nodes are required on the line, make sure that they do not divide the original line during creation.It should be anyway If it happens that the line has been divided, the structure can be restored using the ""Delete nodes and connect adjacent members"" command.In exceptional cases, the use of the layered mesh can be deactivated in the details for the layered structure. This option was implemented specifically for double curved panes. "

Which functions are available to me when exchanging data between Grasshopper and RFEM?,"After successfully installing the interface, the RFEM5 toolbar is available to the user. The export to RFEM can be controlled via the associated components. These are simply dragged and dropped into the programming interface. An import from RFEM is not possible. The ""RFEM 5 COM Component"" enables communication between Grasshopper and RFEM. As soon as this component is controlled with geometric information, the export is started. This expects an open RFEM file. It is advisable to use an empty file, as the export overwrites all information. An update mechanism is currently not implemented. The unit with which the geometry is described can also be defined using a ""Value List"". Changes to the tolerances are usually only necessary if points have been defined very close together. The number to be stored for this can be entered via a ""panel"".The ""RFEM 5 Member Component"" allows the user to attach additional information to the geometry (lines, curves). These are taken into account when exporting to RFEM, so that members can be created. The material and cross-section name must be specified in a text field (panel). The rod rotation can be defined using a ""Number Slider"" in [rad]. For the definition of member hinges, the ""RFEM 5 Member Hinge Component"" must also be loaded. The input consists of the 6 degrees of freedom which can be controlled individually. To release a degree of freedom, the value ""0"" must be defined; spring constants are expected in the units [N/m] or [Nm/rad]. Changing the unit is not possible. Non-linearities cannot currently be controlled.The ""RFEM 5 Surface Component"" can be used in the same way as the ""Member"" component. The geometry input expects a surface. The material can be attached to this via a ""panel"". The thickness of the area can be defined in [m] using a number slider. The stiffness type of the surface can be controlled via a ""Value List"" with predefined types.Nodal supports can be generated via the ""RFEM 5 Nodal Support Component"". The points to be stored are to be defined on the input side. The use of existing definition nodes for areas or lines is recommended here. All 6 degrees of freedom can be controlled. The value ""0"" means a release in the respective direction, ""-1"" a fixed bearing. Spring constants can be defined analogously to the rod end hinges. The Grasshopper The file from the graphic has been made available for download. Only the ""RFEM 5 COM Component"" has to be activated. "

What is the procedure for performing an earthquake analysis in RFEM/RSTAB?,"The additional modules RF-/DYNAM Pro - natural vibrations and RF-/DYNAM Pro - equivalent loads are available. This makes it possible to carry out the multimodal response spectrum method. After the analysis in the additional modules, the calculated earthquake loads are exported in load cases, which can be evaluated as usual. You can also evaluate the floor displacement and the horizontal shear of the building. These and other functions are explained in detail in the webinar ""Earthquake analysis in RFEM "" explained."
How can I read the axial and hoop stress on a circular vessel?,"Since surfaces only have the x and y directions in the plane, it must first be determined which is to be the circumferential and which is the axial stress. In the following example, sigma_x should be the axial stress and sigma_y the hoop stress.The example consists of an inclined circular container. After modelling, the program attempts to align the local axis systems with the global axis system. For the present case, however, the x-axis should run along the container for all surfaces. This alignment can be achieved as follows.First, the z-axis of all faces must point inwards or outwards. In the example, outward direction was selected. If this is not the case for a surface, the z-axis can be brought to the other side of the surface by right-clicking on this surface and using the ""Reverse local axis system"" function. Then all surfaces are selected and the Axes tab is selected in the surface dialog. In this case, one of the axial boundary lines was chosen for alignment. All x-axes run axially and all y-axes run in the circumferential direction. The results of the membrane stresses axially (sigma-x,m) and over the circumference (sigma-y,m). "

Which functions are available to me when exchanging data between Rhino and RFEM?,"Basically, the interface is very easy to use. After successful installation, the Dlubal toolbar is available to the user in Rhino. This contains two icons (export and import). Using ""Import"", data can be imported from RFEM into Rhino to be imported. The entire RFEM model is always imported. An update does not take place. The data is appended to the existing structure.Data can be exported from Rhino to RFEM via ""Export"". Normally, the entire structure is exported. If you only want to export parts of the structure, these must be selected before triggering the export. In order for the export to take place, RFEM must be started and a file must be created. It should be noted that the export will overwrite any existing data in the opened file. It is therefore advisable to open an empty file."
How can I install the interface to Rhino and Grasshopper?,"Please ensure that Rhino (version 6.20 or newer) is already installed. Then carry out the RFEM 5 installation. For this you need at least version 5.21.02.

"With Vz and My, there are two decisive internal forces in the model. In the printout report selection, I only activated these two internal forces with the ""Extreme values"" option. Why then are duplicate result lines output in the report under ""Members - Internal forces""?","In this case, the reason for four result lines is that a minimum and a maximum including the associated remaining internal forces are output for each selected internal force. First line: numerical maximum of Vz (3.54 kN) with associated internal forcesSecond line : numerical minimum of Vz (0 kN) with associated internal forcesThird line: numerical maximum of My (0 kNm) with associated internal forcesFourth line: numerical minimum of My (-12.37 kNm) with associated Internal forces"
"In a model with surface supports, the calculation does not converge or there are very large deformations and implausible stresses. What are the reasons for this?","The definition of the surface bearings should be as realistic as possible. Experience shows that the solver works most effectively with this. Degrees of freedom are often defined as ""fixed"" for simplification. However, this can have a major impact on the overall stiffness matrix and cause numerical problems.It is better to work with springs here to avoid the numerical problems. The definition of very stiff springs is often sufficient. The same also applies to the bedding perpendicular to the surface. You can find more information on this in [1] and in the links below this FAQ."

Can I assign identical profile or cross-section names with the SHAPE-THIN program?,"Basically you can assign any cross-section name with the program SHAPE-THIN. However, you should be careful if you give different cross-sections the same name.Because of the data structure stored in the program, profiles with identical names are overwritten by the program. In this case, the database of the program SHAPE-THIN is linked to the programs RFEM and RSTAB. Duplicate data management would inevitably lead to conflicts on the part of the program.If the user repeatedly wants to assign identical names, he can edit the EigProf.dat file in the relevant directory (e.g. C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\RFEM 5.xx\General Data). The user-defined profiles are stored in this file."
Why are the results of the load cases e.g. B. the self-weight load case is not identical to the first construction stage in the RF-/STAGES module?,"If identical settings are defined in the main program, the reason is often that the partial material safety factor is not taken into account in the load case. In the RF-/STAGES module, all calculations are always carried out taking the partial safety factor. If this is not taken into account, it must be set specifically for the material."
How can you authorize the RWIND Simulation program with a hardware key on a single-user computer?,"The RWIND Simulation program is protected against unauthorized use. The program can be authorized with a standalone or network hardware key. To do this, the single-user hardware key must be plugged into the local computer or the network hardware key must be plugged into a computer available in the network.

In the settings for the serviceability limit state check you will find the option ""Automatically increase the required longitudinal reinforcement for the SLS check"". The ""Limit states"" entry is only available in the results navigator if the automatic increase in longitudinal reinforcement has been activated. "
How is the form of a curved surface structure (compression shell) that is only subjected to compression loads effectively determined with RFEM?,"The effectiveness of a compressive tensile structure depends on its shape. For each load distribution, there is an associated optimum form that transfers the loads to the foundations using as little material as possible. Since the use of a supporting structure is usually If several load states are specified, for purely strategic reasons you should align the optimal form with the main load (permanent load) of the model. The program RFEM, in conjunction with the add-on module RF-FORM-FINDING, helps to find these model forms. The underlying form-finding process shifts the position of the FE mesh nodes in space on the basis of a specified load so that the new position of the elements transfers the load mainly via the membrane load-bearing capacity. Constant stress states in the cross-sections result from the explicit use of the normal force-bearing capacity of members and the membrane force-bearing capacity of the surface elements. This state, free of bending stress, makes optimal use of the cross-sections and enables a very effective supporting structure with minimal use of material. This process can be used for the usual cable and membrane supporting structures made of flexible elements that are under tension as well as for pressure-loaded, rigid beam and shell structures be applied. Proceed as follows to develop an optimal pressure shell shape in RFEM: Activate the RF-FORM-FINDING module in the ""General Data"" under the ""Options"" tab "" Specification of the form-finding settings for the supporting elements Determination of the main load for the design Form-finding analysisThe finally developed form can then be RFEM can be used for the structural analysis with regard to the other variable loads."
Can I define different stiffnesses for tension and compression between two surfaces in a line release diagram?,"The definition of different properties in the tension and pressure area of a line release is possible . With a line release between two areas, however, a special feature must be observed with regard to the released area. An identical line release is defined in the attached model. The model on the left has the bottom surface 1 released, while the model on the right has the top surface 4 released. Both surfaces have the local y-axis of the surface aligned parallel to the global z-axis. The deformation image gives completely different deformations for both models. In the left model with the bottom released surface, the depressed area is very soft. For this axis orientation, the reaction force of surface 2 pressing on surface 1 from above is very soft. In the right model, the upper surface is released, so that the reaction force of surface 4 pressing on surface 3 from above is very stiff."
I have modeled a single span beam from several members. Why are some of the signs of the shear force curve wrong?,"It is very likely that there is no uniform member orientation. As soon as the member orientation is uniform (right-click on the member → ""Reverse member orientation"") , the signs of the shear force curve also match. "

Furthermore, the quality and the recording frequency can be set. The [Start] button starts the recording, the [End] button ends the recording."
How can you simulate buildings with window openings as a closed unit in RWIND Simulation?,"Possible window, door and facade openings can be closed in RWIND Simulation using the model simplification (shrink wrapping mesh) for the wind flow calculation. This meshing option ""seals"" the imported models against intrusion of wind flow into the model with associated internal pressure loading. The program uses a size specification to regulate which openings should be closed and which openings should remain open. This means that all openings whose dimensions are smaller than the specified control dimension can be closed generically for the wind flow calculation in the numerical wind tunnel. In RWIND Simulation, the opening size specification is organized in the ""Edit model"" menu of the respective model. The interface menu in RFEM or RSTAB organizes the opening size specification for the Automated calculation of the wind loads in the background in the ""Simulate and generate wind loads"" menu under the ""Wind load"" tab. Alternatively, additional Surfaces in the opening areas via an STL import or directly via a load-distributing surface are taken into account in RFEM."

How does RF-GLASS determine the composite stiffness?,"RF-GLASS distinguishes between two different types of calculation. On the one hand the so-called ""2D"" calculation. The glass structure is shown as a surface element. If the shear bond is taken into account, an equivalent cross-section is determined using the laminate theory. In contrast to this is the ""3D"" calculation. Here, the layer structure is mapped as a volume element in the calculation and thus the effectiveness of the stiffnesses between the foil and glass is precisely recorded, taking into account the shear bond.More information on the calculation theory is also available in the RF-GLASS manual, Chapter 2. "
Are there programs or additional modules that are specially designed for glass construction?,"Glass constructions can be calculated in RFEM with the add-on module RF-GLASS.

How does RWIND Simulation determine the pressure from the wind load on the surfaces of the model?,"For the calculation, the program creates a volume mesh between the model and the outside of the wind tunnel. Here, the volume mesh does not connect directly to the model geometry, but to a separate model envelope mesh placed around the model geometry. Depending on the model mesh setting (Simplified Model - Shrink Wrapping Mesh), this model envelope mesh has a certain distance to the exact model geometry. The exact model geometry itself is similar to the surrounding model envelope network, also represented from an envelope network, but on the exact model form. With the OpenFOAM calculation results in each Solid a print result. These values are extrapolated to the respective edge nodes at the transition to the model. To determine the final surface pressures on the model geometry, the pressures at the edge nodes of the volume mesh are transformed to the exact model mesh envelope in a further step. In the event that the triangular meshing of the exact model mesh geometry is too coarse, the final transformation process initiates a partial densification of the exact model mesh envelope. "
"Can you design coffered slabs, ribbed slabs or hollow core slabs in RFEM?","Yes, you can use the RF-CONCRETE Surfaces module to design coffered slabs, ribbed slabs or hollow core slabs. The design is possible for the ultimate limit state. The slabs can be created in RFEM as an orthotropic surface."
Can I somehow verify the bending moment determined in RF-/FOUNDATION Pro from the integration of the base stresses?,"This is possible via a detour in RFEM. And the soil pressure, from which the bending moment for the design is determined by means of integration, can be stored in an RFEM substitute model as ""external Load"". Compressive stress distribution in RF-/FUND Pro This compressive stress can be applied to an equivalent system in RFEM as a ""free area load"". The equivalent system in this case is a rigid surface. The size of the area depends on the position of the design section set in RF-/FOUNDATION Pro. In this case, ""in the middle of the column"" was set. With this substitute system, this can be done in RF-/FOUNDATION Recalculate per determined ""Moment from compressive stress distribution"". You can download the example described above using the following link and open it in RFEM 5."
Is there a way to export / import a combination scheme COMPLETELY?,You can save the manually or automatically created and adjusted combination schemes and use them in another RSTAB/RFEM file. A simple example is shown in the video.
The load distribution in RFEM shows unloaded FE elements in the middle of the model for loads from RWIND Simulation. What is the reason?,"For the example, no load distribution is shown between the outer facade elements. Unloaded cells are not displayed according to the color scale in the load distribution, but remain empty. The value of these elements is therefore 0. This has the advantage that it is immediately recognized that FE elements are not loaded. The cause of the problem can be made visible directly in RWIND Simulation. There, a simplified model is used for calculations by default. Depending on the setting, the shell of the model can be refined or coarsened. A FE mesh is placed over the structure and depending on the level of detail, this FE mesh fits the model. In picture 02 the extent of the insufficient level of detail is visible. The surfaces protruding from the facade are not mapped well enough and no wind flows between the cantilevered surfaces in the simulation, which is why these interior surfaces do not experience any wind pressure. The level of detail can be adjusted in RWIND Simulation via ""Edit model"" or directly in RFEM in the settings for wind load simulation . Optionally, the simplified model can also be completely deactivated in RWIND Simulation. With a higher level of detail (corresponds to a finer FE mesh), the projecting surfaces are mapped cleanly and the FE elements are loaded accordingly. "
According to which theoretical approaches are the forces or moments broken down and the reinforcement layout carried out in RF-/FOUNDATION Pro for bucket foundations with rough inner sides?,"The theoretical approaches for this can be found in ""Fritz Leonhardt, lectures on solid construction, third part, 3rd edition."" be understood. Here, special reference should be made to Chapter 16.3 ""Individual foundations for columns""."
The cross-section suddenly twists within the member or a group of members.What is the cause and how can it be rectified?,"The cause is the automatic alignment of the local axes in relation to the global axis system. In most cases it is sufficient to specify a member rotation using an angle or auxiliary node. However, if the inclination of the member reverses, it must be divided and then adjusted via the member rotation. You can find a detailed description of the member rotation angle in RSTAB and RFEM in the links below."
Where to change the display properties of the cross section outline?,"The display properties of the cross-section outline can be set in the Display Properties dialog (Options menu → Display Properties → Edit). The settings can be found in the category Colors → Miscellaneous → Cross-section outer outline or Colors → Miscellaneous → Cross-section inner outline. The line color, type and thickness can be set separately for the screen and the printout report."
"We have a project for which the entire output is in English. In the printout report, we have changed the language from German to English via ""Settings → Language"". We noticed that some terms are not translated. How can we adjust this?","In general, we recommend working with the English program interface if an English printout report is to be created. This should display most of it in English. However, this does not apply to designations that were previously created in German. These would have to be changed manually."
Which cross-sections can I design in the RF-/TIMBER Pro module?,"Basically, all cross-sections of the solid and hybrid cross-section group can be designed in the RF-/TIMBER Pro program. In the case of more complex asymmetrical cross-section shapes, the permissible main axis angle may have to be customized in the module."
"When importing an RFEM/RSTAB file into Autodesk Revit, I get the error message about the load combination ""The given name is not unique Parameter name: name"".

The relevant load combination can be found in the error message. The model contains the load combination LK1 and LK2. Both load combinations have the same description ""ULS"". One of the two descriptions must be changed so that an import is possible. "
"I get the error ""Cannot create extrusion"" when importing an RFEM file into Autodesk Revit. How can the error be corrected?","The import is not possible due to modeling inaccuracies, so the error message is issued. The surface 1 is not absolutely flat. The coordinate X of nodes 1-4 is not the same. If this modeling inaccuracy is eliminated, the import is possible."
I load two bars connected at an angle with the load generator. Why are the load values at the rod ends not identical?,"The system1 is loaded with the load generator. Because of the different bar lengths, the load sizes on the two bars are not the same. The right-angled connection of the bars to the bisecting line is to be understood as the load application length. This is exactly the same in both cases. These also agree with the rod model."

How can you rotate a nodal support?,"In the dialog ""Edit nodal support"" it is possible to rotate the local axis system of the support. First select the sequence that regulates the order of the local bearing axes X', Y' and Z', and then enter the angle of rotation around the global axes X, Y and Z in the corresponding input fields.The Bearing rotation can also be determined graphically using the associated buttons in the dialog. The rotation of the support is displayed dynamically in the dialog graphic.After the calculation, the support reactions of a rotated nodal support can be evaluated with reference to both the global and the local axis system."
Various stiffness coefficients can be activated in the calculation parameters of a load case or load combination. What exactly is behind it?," The stiffness modifications can be controlled separately for the following elements: MaterialsCross-sectionsBeamsSurfaces Materials By default, the first option ""Materials"" is only activated for load combinations, since the second-order theory is preset for this. If the function is activated, the stiffness of all elements is reduced by the partial safety factor of the material. This is particularly important in timber construction in Europe. If the automatic load combination was selected for the standard EN 1990 + EN 1995, SIA 260 + SIA 265 or DIN 1055-100 + DIN 18008, different standard settings result. If the material's partial safety factor is defined as 1.0, it does not matter whether the function is activated or not. Cross Sections This option controls the multiplication factors for individual cross sections. The moments of inertia and areas of the cross section can be adjusted in the ""Modify"" tab of the ""Edit Cross Section"" dialog. This influences the stiffness of the cross-sections. Members When editing a member, the ""Modify Stiffness"" dialog tab is available. There are different definition types. The ""Multiplicative Factors"" option allows modifying the stiffness of individual members in the same way as the cross-sections. Surfaces For surfaces of type ""Standard"" and ""tension-free"" the stiffness of the surface can be adjusted in the ""Edit surface"" dialog in the ""Modify stiffness"" tab. There (as with orthotropic surfaces) the elements of the stiffness matrix can be modified with a factor. Further possibilities of stiffness modification In addition, can Another option can be selected in the calculation parameters in order to specifically adapt the stiffnesses for other elements. When you check the ""Modify stiffnesses"" option, a new tab appears. In addition to the member and surface stiffnesses, the stiffnesses of bearings and joints can also be individually adjusted there. Interaction of individual factors If several factors have been defined for an element (e.g. from cross-section and member), these are multiplied with each other. The example results in: Ely,mod =0,5 ×0,5 ×El y Ely,mod=0,25 ×Ely Global stiffness modification control In the global calculation parameters all the previously mentioned options can be deactivated at once. The local settings in the calculation parameters of the load cases or load combinations are ignored."

If the acting normal force exceeds 5% of the plastic stress capacity Npl,Rd, equation 6.24 applies."
"To which cross-sections can the member load ""internal pipe pressure"" be applied?","The ""Internal pipe pressure"" member load can only be applied to the following cross-sections in the cross-section library:Rolled circular hollow sectionsParametric - thin-walled pipe sections For all other cross-sections that are loaded with this member load, an error message is displayed before the calculation.

A PC is used by several users. Every user wants to use a different directory structure in the project manager. How can this be done?,"The directory structure in the project manager is managed in the PRO.DLP file. By default, it is located in the C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\Global\Project Manager folder. You can check the directory paths of the project manager in the ""Program Options"" dialog (Project Manager menu ""Edit → Program Options""). This database file is available to all users. If each user is to use a different project structure, a PRO.DLP could be created for each user (e.g. PRO_User1.DLP, PRO_User2.DLP). The respective database file must then be set by the user concerned in the program options after each user change."
A PC is used by several users. Are the custom materials available to all users of the PC?,"The custom materials are available across users. All users must have full access rights to the custom materials database path.Custom materials are stored in the Materials_User.dbd file.

I have a surface with complicated geometry and I would like to know the area for it. Does RFEM output the area somewhere?,"You can query the area content via the context menu. To do this, right-click on any area of the entered structure. In the context menu you will find the entry ""Focus and info..."" In the dialog that then appears, you will find the information available about this area. There you will find e.g. B. the area or the weight.Optionally, a node can also be created in the center of gravity of the selected area. A multiple selection of surfaces is also possible. "
"What does ""shear failure of the bonded contact surface"" mean in the details of the RF-LAMINATE module?","In the case of non narrow side glued cross laminated timber panels and a wall-like load-bearing behavior is often the Torsional stress in the adhesive joints is decisive.

"In RFEM, I want to load a circular ring, which is displayed as a member, with the load generator. However, the curved bar is not considered. Why is that?","The function [Generate loading → From area load on members using plane...] assumes that the defined plane is created from a polyline. If a curved member is created from arcs, the plane as a polygon cannot find the outer contour of the arc, since this is only an approximation. In short, curved members cannot be loaded with the load generator in RFEM. In this case, it is advisable to represent the curved member using several straight member segments. In this way, the polygon course can be traversed cleanly. In order to create the corner nodes of the polyline more quickly, it is advisable, depending on the number of member segments, to e.g. B. in Excel. The numbering of the nodes is important. The procedure can be found in the video."
Can I also define a load as an acceleration [m/s²]?,"Yes, this is possible via the load generator. In the ""Extras"" menu under ""Generate load"" you will find the command ""From movement..."". In the ""Generate loads from motion"" dialog, an acceleration a in [m/ s²] can be defined with which - depending on the mass of the structure - a load can be determined. In RSTAB, a load can be generated on a member. In RFEM on a member, a surface or a solid. Important: The program uses the self-weight of the structure. The mass from a specific load case cannot be applied here."
Is it possible to save a file in an earlier version in RSTAB 8 or RFEM 5?,"No, unfortunately this is not possible. If you save the last version of your model in RSTAB or RFEM, then this happens in the currently used version. In principle, you can also open RSTAB 8 files in RSTAB 7 and RSTAB 5 files in RFEM 4. However, please note the information in FAQ004112 in the link below."
"When I decompose a member into surfaces, I get an instability in the calculation. Why?","If you break down a member into surfaces, you then have to establish the connection between the newly created surfaces and the existing members. This can be done, for example, with a rigid surface (option ""Create end plates at member ends"" in the settings)."
Why is there no resultant support force for result combinations?,"A specific combination of loads is required for a resultant, which result combinations cannot offer.The following example quickly shows the problem. A single-span beam is loaded with three different load cases. The result envelope of the 6 possible load combinations results in a maximum PZ of 11.25 kN for the support at node 1 from the result of LK2. The bearing at node 2 has a maximum PZ of 12 kN from the result of LK1. However, the resultant of 23.25 kN does not occur in any of the load combinations involved and is therefore too large (maximum LK 1 and LK 2 with 22.5 kN).The situation is similar with the pure result combination from the load cases that have the same maximum values PZ of the nodal supports 1 and 2. Here, however, it is not evident that a resultant would deliver incorrect results.For this reason, a resultant is not used for result combinations, since the results can be incorrect."
How can you create an imperfection via the COM interface?,"An imperfection is considered a load and is passed through the interface of the load case. With the prerequisite that the interface to the model has already been fetched, the interface to the loads (ILoads) and then the interface to load case 1 (ILoadCase) is fetched, insofar as this has already been created: ' set loadcases Dim iLoads As iLoads Set iLoads = model.GetLoads ' get load case Dim iLc1 As ILoadCase Set iLc1 = iLoads.GetLoadCase(1, AtNo) ' define imperfection Dim imperf As Imperfection imperf.Comment = ""test"" imperf.Direction = LocalZType imperf.Inclination = 200 imperf.no = 1 imperf.ObjectList = 1 imperf.Precamber = 300 imperf.PrecamberActivity = ActivityAccording_EN_1993_1_1 ' set imperfection iLc1.PrepareModification iLc1.SetImperfection imperf iLc1.FinishModification The data of the imperfection (Imperfection) are then filled in first, here for bar 1, and then within a prepare - Pass/FinishModification blocks of the load case interface."
"How are the results of the RWIND simulation calculation compatible with the applicable wind standards (e.g. EN 1991-1-4, ASCE/SEI 7, etc.)?","The program RWIND Simulation is a program for numerical flow simulation. This is a tool for describing a wind flow problem around an object from a system of partial differential equations with the output of an approximate solution based on the finite volume method. Similar to a simplified model in a real wind tunnel, such a mathematical model provides information about the wind speed field and the pressures acting on the surfaces of the wind-blown object. The standards for describing the wind effects on buildings and components (e.g. EN 1991-1-4, ASCE/SEI 7, etc.) are based on other principles. The regulations provide appropriate instructions for determining the wind loads for specific situations and applications. These sets of formulas are undeniably correct for the assigned situations and the resulting values have been confirmed in practice. Unfortunately, however, these guidelines do not describe all situations that occur in the real world of engineers. Here, infinitely different model shapes standing in the wind flow are processed, with each shape having its own high-level influence on the resulting surface pressures from wind loading. However, the equivalent load from the wind action remains unclear for all model forms not mentioned in the respective guidelines. RWIND Simulation can help here in its role as an auxiliary tool for determining the resulting forces from the wind action. However, despite the use of RWIND Simulation, all the requirements of the applicable standard must be met. The technology used in the simulation program can also provide further useful insights for object shapes that are sufficiently regulated in the standard. "
Which turbulence setting to use for numerical wind load generation on buildings?,"The RWIND Simulation program offers an optional consideration of the k-ε or k-ω turbulence model for the numerical flow simulation, which changes over the height. The turbulence parameters required for this can be specified manually or determined automatically from a user-defined turbulence intensity value. In the standard, a constant turbulence intensity of 1% is specified over the wind tunnel height. This value is based on a recommendation from CFD Support, which has many years of experience in the field of numerical flow simulation. The Standard k-epsilon Model is used for the k-ε turbulence model . For the k-ω turbulence model, the SST k-omega Model is used. In RWIND Simulation, the turbulence model is organized in the ""Simulation Parameters"" menu under the ""Turbulence"" tab. The interface menu in RFEM or RSTAB organizes the turbulence model for the automated calculation of the wind loads in the background in the ""Simulate and Generate Wind Loads"" menu under the ""Wind Load "". The ""Use uniform turbulence at the inlet"" function in the Turbulence properties field produces a constant turbulence specification over the height of the wind tunnel. Deactivating this function enables a turbulence specification that varies with altitude. With the wind description according to the standard, in addition to the location-specific specification of the wind speed profile, the turbulence properties dependent on the terrain roughness are also automatically defined via the height. Alternatively, the turbulence property can also be specified manually in the form of a table entry using the ""Custom turbulence"" function. "
How do I create a circular opening in a tube?,"Creating the hole using penetrationTo create the hole, you need to create an area through the pipe wall with the diameter of the hole. With the ""Create penetration"" function, individual components are created, which can then be deactivated. The procedure can be found in the video. Creating the opening using a converted penetration lineIt is also possible to convert the found penetration line into a normal line. Then the penetration can be erased and an opening placed in it. The inserted opening must then be manually integrated into the surface (see video). However, it should be noted that the quality of a penetration is higher than the converted penetration line. When using the converted penetration line, there may be discontinuities in the rendering or in the FE mesh, depending on the model. "
How can I subsequently change a member via the COM interface?,"In order to be able to change an existing element, the interface for the corresponding element must be fetched, here using the example of a staff: Dim iModel As RSTAB8.model Set iModel = GetObject(, ""RSTAB8.Model"") iModel.GetApplication.LockLicense Dim iModData As IModelData Set iModData = iModel.GetModelData Dim iMem As RSTAB8.IMember Set iMem = iModData.GetMember(1, AtNo) This code is used to get the interface to bar 1, which has already been created have to be. Then the bar data can be fetched using the .GetData() method of the interface.If data is to be modified (like the bar rotation here), this can then be done within a Prepare/FinishModification block using the . SetData() to be passed to the program: Dim mem As RSTAB8.Member mem = iMem.GetData mem.Rotation.Angle = 0.5 mem.Rotation.Type = RSTAB8.Angle iModData.PrepareModification iMem.SetData mem iModData.FinishModification"
"When calculating an oblique slab, I get very high result values for the line supports at 2 edge nodes. Why is this and how can this be avoided?","The standard definition of the surface elements assumes an isotropic material behavior. The load tries to reach the bearings as quickly as possible. The rigidity of the elements also plays a role. For slabs, the load-bearing behavior or the load transfer can best be represented and understood with the trajectories of the main moments αb. In the case of wall elements, the trajectories of the main normal forces αm must be considered. In this example, the load transfer does not take place parallel to the free plate edges, but almost at right angles to the supports, as this is the shortest path of the load transfer is. The load application area is larger at the obtuse corners of the system than in the middle of the bearing, corresponds to a singularity point and this results in large peak values. To now force the system to transfer the load parallel to free plate edges, the following procedure is the fastest: Definition of an orthotropic plate. The ""Effective Thicknesses"" orthotropy type is recommended here. The thickness of the actual plate thickness is specified in the load-bearing direction and a very small thickness (e.g. 1mm) in the secondary load-bearing effect. The second graphic shows the difference between the two models."
"Why are imperfections taken into account in RFEM and RSTAB when calculating according to the first-order theory, although by definition no component deformations are considered according to the first-order theory?","An imperfection generally describes the imperfection of a structure or the manufacturing-related deviation of a component from the ideal shape. There are different ways to simulate the imperfection. Imperfections are represented as equivalent loads in RSTAB and RFEM. The definition of the equivalent loads comes from [1]. The same is described in EC3[2]. Since these are equivalent loads that are dependent on the normal force, they are also taken into account in a calculation based on the first-order theory. It is good practice to manage loads and imperfections in separate load cases. These can be combined with one another in a suitable manner in load combinations. Load cases with pure imperfection loads are to be classified as the “imperfection” action type in the basic load case data."
What does note 40162 say about the shear strength of the Binderholz company?,"For the structures of the manufacturer Binderholz, as soon as the panels are defined without narrow side bonding and a proof of the shear failure in the plane of the panel is calculated, the shear strengths are calculated according to the following equation. $f_ {v,k}=min\left\{\begin{array}{l}\begin{array}{c}3.5\\8.0\frac{D_{net}}D\\\end{array }\\2.5\frac{(n-1)(a²+b²)}{6*D*b}\end{array}\right.$ Values:D element thicknessDnet Total of the longitudinal and transverse layer thicknesses in the elementn Number of board layersa=b Width of the boards in the longitudinal or transverse layers All values in N/mm². See the manufacturer's approval for more detailed information."
"When exporting the additional required area reinforcement to REVIT, the displayed graphic in REVIT and RFEM does not match, how can I fix this?","In RFEM, the graphical results are smoothed based on the results at FE mesh points. The results are transferred to REVIT based on the results at grid points. In RFEM, the grid for the surfaces is set to 0.5m by default. Set a fine grid for the surfaces here and the graphical representation of the results in RFEM and REVIT are comparable."
"I bought the ""EC2 for RFEM"" module for reinforced concrete design. Where can I start this module?","In this sense, ""EC2 for RFEM"" is not an additional module that you can start separately, but a standard, according to which you can design reinforced concrete components in RF-CONCRETE surfaces or RF-CONCRETE members, for example. You can find the selection of the design standard in the respective module in the ""Basic data"" dialog. The same applies to ""EC2 for RSTAB"". A design standard, here the ""EC2"", is used in the following modules requires: - RF-CONCRETE in RFEM 5- CONCRETE in RSTAB 8- RF-/CONCRETE Columns in RFEM 5 and RSTAB 8- RF-PUNCH Pro (only available for RFEM 5)"
Which programs and modules does Dlubal Software have for solid construction?,"In principle, both RFEM and RSTAB are possible solutions.

cannot define the pretension separately for warp and weft threads in RF-FORM-FINDING. How can I activate this?,"The directions of the warp and weft threads are linked to the axes of the surface. With the default setting, only an isotropic prestress can be applied. If the axes are aligned, an orthotropic or radial preload can also be specified.The procedure is shown in the video."
How to set the calculation parameters using the COM interface?,The following code example shows the fetching of various calculation parameters via the COM interface.

Which mesh size should be set for a numerical wind flow analysis? ,"The density and quality of the finite volume mesh significantly affects the accuracy of the results. The denser the mesh, the more accurate the results. At the same time, however, a denser network increases the computing time and the demands on the computer's main memory.The networking of RWIND simulation can be divided into 3 categories:CategoryMesh densityMesh cellsCalculation timeSupercomputers Alow≤ 1 million several minutes ≤ 4 GB RAM B medium1 - 10 million several hours ≤ 16 GB RAM Chigh10 - 50 million several 10 hours ≤ 64 GB RAM In RWIND Simulation, the mesh density is organized globally in the ""Simulation Parameters"" dialog. The mesh density can be set in the range between 10% and 100%. However, to increase the calculation efficiency in the wind tunnel room, the program does not create a mesh with a constant mesh density, but automatically generates a finer mesh in the immediate vicinity of the wind-blown models than in the rest of the area. The size of the mesh compression for each model is controlled using 5 levels of detail in the ""Edit model"" dialog . The level of refinement can be set here with levels 0-4. By default, the program gives a global mesh density of 20% with level 2 mesh refinement model forward. This setting usually results in a category A network distribution with 300 to 700,000 cells. With this coarse-meshed category A configuration, the program provides a basic representation of the flow field and the pressure distribution on the wind-flow model within a very short time. After checking all input data and pressure reactions on the model, you can quickly switch to category B meshing in the mentioned dialogs by increasing the mesh density and mesh refinement level to determine a higher-quality result.By using the finer mesh refinement options and refinement levels, meshing can also be performed of category C can be achieved. During the development of the RWIND Simulation program, we successfully tested such network configurations (≥ 50 million) on an appropriate computer. However, we do not recommend this configuration at the moment, since the increased accuracy of the results obtained is not in balance with the required computer requirements. "
Is it possible in RFEM and RSTAB to define a member entirely using the tabular input?,"Yes, this is possible. You can enter all the necessary input for:NodesLinesMaterialsCross sectionsBearingEnter completely using the tables provided. If the cross-section designation is known from the Dlubal cross-section library, it can also be entered directly in column A in Table 1.13. Otherwise, the cross-section library can also be opened via the cell. In the same way, this is also possible in RSTAB. In this case, the input of the line is omitted. This is only necessary in RFEM."
How can I create a results bar using the COM interface?,"A result bar is initially created just like a normal bar: Dim model As RFEM5.model Set model = GetObject(, ""RFEM5.Model"") model.GetApplication.LockLicense On Error GoTo e Dim data As IModelData Set data = model.GetModelData Dim members(0) As RFEM5.Member members(0).No = 3 members(0).LineNo = 12 members(0).Type = ResultBeamType members(0).StartCrossSectionNo = 1 members(0).EndCrossSectionNo = 1 members(0).Comment = ""result beam 1"" data.PrepareModification data.SetMembers members data.FinishModification After that, the IMember interface must be fetched from the corresponding stick and the GetExtraData method is used to get the interface to IResultMember.

Can I use RWIND Simulation to analyze a framework located behind a building envelope without modeling the building envelope? The loads should be distributed to the members.,"If the building envelope is not modeled, the wind load in RWIND Simulation only acts on the surfaces of the members. Elements that would distribute the pressure between the bars do not exist. In this case, the ""close holes"" function is not suitable for replacing the surfaces. This means that an automatic transfer of the wind load to RSTAB or RFEM is not possible.However, you can model the building shell in RFEM in a separate model and have it analyzed in RWIND Simulation. The wind pressure can then z. B. be created manually with the load generators as a load. The procedure is shown in the video."
"When I display a slab from above, the free rectangular loads have no hatching despite being activated under Show → Rendering → Loads. Unfortunately, this is not ideal for the display in the printout report. Can you help me?","Compared to ""normal"" area loads, free rectangular loads have the disadvantage that the load is not graphically ""covered"" and the load distribution is therefore not clearly recognizable in the graphic printout.You could find out about the display of the load distribution in the project navigator - help results: With this, 2D FE elements are colored graphically and the associated values are output in the adjacent color panel."
Is there a way to hide background slides?,Background slides can be shown or hidden in the Show navigator under Auxiliary Objects → Background Slides. The visibility can be defined individually or for all together. 
What are the hardware and system requirements for the RWIND program?,"The minimum computer configuration for RWIND is: RAM RAM: 4 GBProcessor CPU: x64Free mass storage: 10 GBScreen and graphics card resolution: 1280 x 800 pxOperating system: Microsoft Windows 10 64 bitFor use of all program capacities, there is the following recommended computer configuration: RAM RAM: 64 GBProcessor CPU: Intel Core i9- 9900K with 8 physical cores or better. The number of cores has a positive effect on the calculation time and the respective individual core performance on the pure program operation and preparation of the graphics data. Free mass storage: 100 GBGraphics card : A modern ATI or NVIDIA graphics card with OpenGL support (e.g. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 or better). The built-in GPU is not addressed by the calculation.Screen resolution: 1920 x 1200 pxOperating system: Microsoft Windows 10 64 bitRWIND does not limit the performance of the OpenFOAM calculation. Hardware recommendations that apply to OpenFOAM can also be used for RWIND.The general rule is: the better the hardware, the better. But a distinction must be made between the OpenFOAM calculation and the RWIND GUI (pre-processing and post-processing).The OpenFOAM calculation is completely parallel. The following applies here: the more processors, the better.The RWIND GUI is partially parallel (max. 2-3 processors). The following applies here: the more powerful the individual processor (clock frequency), the better. "
Can an external steel structure also be simulated in RWIND Simulation?,"Yes, the RWIND Simulation program has a general design and can implement any model from RFEM or RSTAB. In the case of a steel structure made up of pure bar elements, the program generates for the numerical wind tunnel a cohesive, voluminous shell of the rod surfaces. The result of this modeling for the simulation depends on the existing cross sections and the mesh settings. Corresponding surface pressures result on this surface envelope due to the wind flow. After the pure wind flow calculation, the program adds up the surface pressures of the rod units and gives a corresponding equivalent load for each rod axis (punctual , constant or trapezoidal). These loads are applied in RFEM or RSTAB for the further calculation of the internal forces. "
"When calculating a curved surface in RF-GLASS, I get the message that the surface has more than 4 boundary lines and therefore a layered FE mesh cannot be used. How can I bypass this message?","For a layered FE mesh, the same requirements apply as for a contact volume. If the requirements are not met, the layered FE mesh must be deactivated in the details of the layer structure."
"For some reason, the preloads are no longer displayed graphically for me. How can I display them again?","In this case, it is usually the case that the ""Prestressing action category"" is hidden in the ""Project Navigator - Show"". All loads that are in a load case with the action category ""prestress"" are no longer displayed in this case. If you activate the function, the loads should be displayed as usual again."
"When modeling I want to place a line release on a component. However, this will not be accepted. How can I bypass this?","Line approvals on components are currently not possible. In the case of linear joint properties, these can be quickly assigned to the components as line joints. Components must not be used with nonlinear joint properties. The ""Convert penetration to line"" option is helpful here. This function is possible from the context menu of the generated penetration line. The area can then be delimited with the new line and the line release assigned."
"I modeled a curved bar with straight bar segments. However, this results in discontinuities in the progression of the cutting force progression. How can this be optimized?","If curved members are modeled using member segments, there are discontinuities in the course of the internal forces at the transition of the individual members due to the different member inclinations, since the nodal equilibrium must be satisfied. If the jumps are too large, it is advisable to increase the number of rod segments in order to minimize the kink between the rods. This gives you a smoother and more accurate progression of the internal forces.Different variants are compared. Above, a curved member has been modeled in RFEM and is used as a reference. Below that, the variants with 150, 50 and 10 bar segments (n) are shown with their results. The finer the division of the bar segments, the more accurate the result. In the [Extras → Generate model - Bars → Arc] menu, these bar segments can also be generated. "
Where can I set the required time t for the fire protection design in RF-/STEEL EC3?,"You can find this setting in the ""Details"" under the ""Fire protection"" tab. You can also control the duration of the fire protection individually for each member or set of members. Then you will find the input for this in Table 1.10 for the members and 1.11 for the trusses.

If the cross-section is to be updated in the user-defined cross-section library, the modified cross-section must be imported again. The security query must be answered with ""Yes"". The video first shows how the BRIDGE cross-section is imported from the Examples folder linked in the project manager. Then the cross-section Example-1 is imported from the Desktop directory, which is not linked to the project manager. The cross sections are now available in the custom cross section library. As an example, the example-1 cross-section is deleted in RFEM and reinserted via the user-defined cross-section library. It is then shown how the example 1 cross-section is changed in SHAPE-THIN and imported again into RFEM."
"When defining the end plate, can the lower overhang be avoided and a HV seam arranged? If not, what is the size of the overhang?","During the development of the RAHMECK-Pro add-on module, the lower end plate overhang was fixed, since this improves the load transfer of the compressive force into the support.

How can you take the real cross-section geometry of bar elements into account in RWIND Simulation?,"The interface application ""Simulate and generate wind loads"" allows the exchange of member, surface and volume elements in RFEM, and of member elements in RSTAB.Simulated to avoid too fine a mesh with the associated long calculation time the program defaults to all members with a rectangular cross-section. The size of the rectangular cross-section is selected so that the real cross-section geometry is just covered. You can bypass this by deactivating the ""Export optimized member topology"" option additional model optimization and allow the real cross-section geometry to be taken into account within the framework of the set meshing settings. Requires the exact representation of the cross-section geometry more than 1000000 elements, the interface automatically switches to the simplified rectangular cross-section representation of the cross-sections."
Can I use RF-STABILITY to perform stability analyzes on reinforced concrete structures?,"Because concrete has a nonlinear material behavior that can only be simulated with the CONCRETE NL module, an analysis with the RF-STABILITY module is not possible.The use of a different material model such as isotropic linear elastic or isotropic plastic would not show the crack formation correctly and the results are therefore not usable.A stability analysis on columns can be carried out with RF-CONCRETE Columns or RF-CONCRETE NL. You can find a small example in the downloads.The example includes the design of a column with the module RF-CONCRETE Columns. It is important to ensure that the calculation of the internal forces in RFEM is based on the first-order theory and that no imperfections are required, since the method used in the module takes them into account.The example also includes the design with RF- CONCRETE NL. Here again, calculations must be based on the second-order theory and imperfections in the form of misalignments are required. For better comparability, the layout of the longitudinal reinforcement was adjusted to the result from RF-CONCRETE columns. Since the reinforcement is optimized by the module after a new calculation, the desired reinforcement was saved as a template (see red arrow)."
"Can a ""Kármán vortex street"" form behind an object in the numerical wind tunnel of RWIND Simulation?","Yes, the effect of a ""Kármán vortex street"" can be modeled in RWIND2 with the ""transient flow"" mode, this was not possible in earlier versions. Particularly narrow and tall models require extremely fine meshing over the entire height. In addition, the effect is strongly dependent on the set Reynolds number and surface roughness. In [1] there is a suitable model as an example, as well as with [2] a visualization and with [3] the corresponding documentation. "

I want to create a ring pipeline from several parts. How do I prevent the transitions from not being connected?,You can define pipe faces on elbows instead of using straight lines for segmentation. An example is shown in the video.
What is behind the b/h ratio when determining the minimum reinforcement according to 9.3.2 in RF-CONCRETE surfaces.,The option controls whether the minimum shear reinforcement is determined based on the dimensions of the member for a slab (w/h > 5) or for a beam (w/h < 4). The height or the thickness of the surface corresponds to h and the smallest edge sound of the component corresponds to b.

"From a certain size, I want the support or rod end hinge to no longer absorb a bending moment. How can I achieve this?","To be able to take this non-linearity into account, you can use the ""Partial Effect"" function. This allows the limit torque to be defined, from which no further torques can be absorbed."
Why do I get much higher ratios in RF-/STEEL than with a cross-section design in RF-/STEEL EC3?,"In the RF-/STEEL add-on module, an equivalent stress analysis is carried out according to von Mises. An elastic stress analysis (EL-EL) is carried out. In RF-/STEEL EC3, a classification is carried out before the design. If the cross-section is classified as Class 1 or Class 2, a design is made against plastic internal forces. There is an EL-PL proof. If you do not want to use the plastic load-bearing reserves, you can switch the design to EL-EL in the details of the RF-/STEEL EC3 add-on module. The results are then comparable with RF-/STEEL."
How can a diagnostic file (authorization.txt) be created for license problems?,"In order to identify the background of your license problems, we need the diagnostic file. This can be created in the [Help → Authorization → Diagnosis] menu. To do this, simply start the program in the demo version. In RX-TIMBER, this file can be created in the [Help → System diagnosis] menu."
How can a quadrangle face be split at a line?,"Unfortunately, quadrangle surfaces cannot be divided as easily as flat surfaces. The procedure is shown in the video. In order to get two surfaces, the surface must either be deleted and recreated, or the boundary lines of the surface must be changed and the second surface recreated."
"When determining the buckling figures in RF-STABILITY, additional lines are displayed for each member at right angles to the buckling line.

This ensures the clarity of the graphic. The graphic representation is regulated directly in the additional module. "
"Why are the results from the calculation with RF-CONCRETE Columns on the individual columns sometimes only showing values at the column foot, column head or column center?","In RF-/CONCRETE Columns, the column is designed as ""Component"". When displaying the results ""Bending"", ""Shear Force"" and ""Bending - Fire Protection"", the Maximum value of the verification criterion as a single value at the relevant point (x-point) of the respective verification. For example at the base of the column, the column head or in the middle of the column. If the result display ""Largest design criterion"" is selected, the maximum value of all design criteria over the entire ""component"" (column) is displayed. "
"am trying to design a cross section created in DICKQ in the RF-/STEEL add-on module. However, the cross section is classified as invalid. What is the reason?","In this case it is worth looking at the stress points in the cross-section details. If these are not accessible (greyed out) then no stress points were defined in DICKQ and a design is not possible. In DICKQ, the ""Stresses in stress points"" option must be activated in the general data. After recalculating and saving, the cross-section can now be designed in the RF-/STEEL add-on module."
"I'm trying to manually control the deformations from the CRANEWAY add-on module. However, I get large discrepancies. How can the differences be explained?","The internal forces and deformations are determined according to the second-order bending torsion theory, taking into account 7 degrees of freedom. With a linear calculation of the deformations, a vertical/horizontal load results in only a vertical/horizontal deformation. Since the internal forces refer to the deformed system and it is a non-linear analysis, this does not apply to the second-order bending torsion theory. The deformations in the shear center can be calculated in RSTAB and RFEM with the add-on module RF-/FE-LTB can be checked. The deformations that also result from the displacements or rotations can only be checked with a surface model in RFEM."
Is it possible in RFEM to consider friction for the horizontal reactions of a surface support?,"This option is only available for surface supports if a non-linearity in the local z direction has also been defined (failure if contact stress in z is negative/positive). In the dialog where the nonlinearity can be edited there is the option ""Friction in plane xy"". This option works like in the graphic in Dialog shown: The support in the x and y direction is only fully assumed when the contact stress Tau (contact stress Sigma times the coefficient of friction) is reached. Before this is reduced linearly.In order to use this option, a support in the horizontal directions must still be defined. This can be defined as fixed or with an elastic spring. If the spring is defined as 0, no support is taken into account even if a friction coefficient is entered."
How do I apply prestress to tension rods?,"To correctly combine the planned prestress with the other load cases, define a suitable load case and apply a ""pulling"" strain load to the affected members. A pulling strain load can e.g. B. a negative temperature load Tc, which is constantly distributed over the cross-section,a negative change in length ε,a negative one longitudinal displacement Δl,a positive initial prestress V oronly in RFEM a positive final prestress V. Entering a longitudinal displacement is the most comprehensible input, since the displacement can be measured directly at the turnbuckle of a tension rod."
Where can I find the installation logs or the MSI log files of a program installation?,The logs or log files of an installation can be found under the following path:C:\Users\Public\Documents\Dlubal\Logs
I have the stiffnesses of my bars available numerically. How can I assign the stiffnesses to a member without having to create a fictitious material and cross-section?,"For this case there is the ""Stiffnesses"" member type. The member stiffnesses can be specified directly in a dialog that can be accessed via the [Edit] button. This means that there is no need to assign a cross-section."
Can I download a test version of RWIND Simulation?,The RWIND Simulation program can be downloaded as a 30-day test version. The download can be found in the link below the FAQ.The activation code for activating the test license must then be requested. This process is described in this FAQ.
I have the problem with my Dlubal programs that umlauts and special characters cannot be displayed. How can I change this? ,In our programs we use the fonts of the operating system.It is necessary to change the region in the operating system control panel. The computer must then be restarted. The texts should then be displayed correctly. 
Can I also use the load generator for members that are not in one plane?,"The load generators ""From area load on members using plane"" or using ""Cells"" can be helpful for irregular member structures. However, both functions assume that the nodes of the members are in one plane. Tolerances for the nodes can be increased in the load generator settings in order to also include nodes that lie outside the plane. In combination with the ""fictitious lines"", more complex structures can also be loaded."
"During a training, it was shown how to enlarge the display field of the load case names. Could you please explain that again?","To customize the column width, right-click in the empty gray space on the toolbar. A context menu appears. Select the ""Adjust"" function there.Now click on the display field of the load case designation. It will be highlighted in black. Move the mouse to the right edge of the field until arrow symbols appear at the cursor. You can now drag the input field larger (or smaller)."
"When I use the ""Apply support reactions as loads"" function, I get the message ""No surface was selected on which the load should act."" What is the background to the message?","According to the default setting in the program, it is defined that the loads act on all surfaces. However, if there is no surface in the file, the load cannot take effect and the warning is issued. If the message is confirmed with ""OK"", the load will still be imported into the model, but will not be applied to any surface. However, as soon as a surface is subsequently defined, the imported loads can act on it."
How can I subsequently adjust my surface model with regard to the FE size without the total number of elements becoming too high?,"Basically, the surfaces of the model have the FE size that was preset in the general FE mesh settings. You can add ""FE mesh refinements"" locally to a surface model. This has the effect that the general FE size in can be retained with the FE mesh settings, but the mesh is refined locally so that more precise results can be expected from the calculation. In this case, the FE mesh refinement can be performed on nodes, lines and surfaces. The setting for this can be found in the ""Edit"" dialogs of the node, line or surface. By using the local FE mesh refinement, the general FE mesh size can be retained or even increased. This keeps the total number of elements in the model relatively small."
Is it possible in RF-GLASS to set user-specific standard values?,"Yes, you can create a new standard for this, in which all values can be modified. This user-specific standard is saved so that it can be used again at any time. "
How can I influence the sag of the found shape in RF-FORM-FINDING?,The sag can be influenced by prestressing the membrane. It should be noted that an equal increase in both directions does not cause a change in shape. A change must therefore only be made in the desired direction. The video shows the procedure.
How is friction adjusted on a rod end joint via the COM interface?,"Friction represents a non-linearity and can therefore only be modified via the interface to the member end hinge.To do this, the member end hinge must first be created if it does not already exist. Then the IMemberHinge interface is fetched to the member hinge and then to the nonlinearity (here IFriction). The data (here Friction) can then be modified using the GetData and SetData methods:Sub SetMemberHingeFriction() Dim model As RFEM5.model Set model = GetObject(, ""RFEM5.Model"") model.GetApplication.LockLicense On Error GoTo e Dim data As IModelData Set data = model.GetModelData Dim hinge(0 To 0) As RFEM5.MemberHinge hinge(0).No = 1 hinge(0).RotationalConstantX = 1 hinge(0).RotationalConstantY = 2 hinge(0).RotationalConstantZ = 3 hinge(0).TranslationalConstantX = 4 hinge(0).TranslationalConstantY = 5 hinge(0).TranslationalConstantZ = 6 hinge(0).Comment = ""Member Hinge 1"" hinge(0).TranslationalNonlinearityX = FrictionAType data.PrepareModification data.SetMemberHinges hinge data.FinishModification ' get interface for member hinge Dim imemhing As IMemberHinge Set imemhing = data.GetMemberHinge(1, AtNo) ' get interface for nonlinearity ""friction"" Dim iFric As IFriction Set iFric = imemhing.GetNonlinearity(AlongAxisX) ' get friction data Dim fric As Friction fric = iFric.GetData fric.Coefficient1 = 0.3 ' set friction data data.PrepareModification iFric.SetData fric data.FinishModification e: If Err.Number <> 0 Then MsgBox Err.Description, , Err.Source Set data = Nothing model.GetApplication.UnlockLicense Set model = Nothing End Sub For the In the case of friction Vy + Vz, the second coefficient can be set via Coefficient2. The deflection spring in the friction dialog is controlled by the deflection spring of the member end hinge. In this specific case, this is TranslationalConstantX for the x-direction."
Are the result values in the FE elements averaged or nodal values? Where can this be set?,"There are two differences when displaying the ""Values on surfaces"" result values.The result values are displayed either at the ""Grid and manually set points"" or at the ""FE mesh points"". When displaying ""In grid and manually set points"", the results are displayed at the spacing of the grid points. The spacing of the grid points is a property of the surface and can be controlled in the ""Edit surface"" dialog. Alternatively, the result values can also be displayed in ""FE mesh points"". The number of FE mesh points then depends on the generated one FE mesh size. The displayed color gradient can be controlled using the ""Course of internal forces/stresses"" option in the display navigator. See the FAQ via the link below."
How do I determine wind loads of structures of any shape?,"The new independent program RWIND Simulation offers you the possibility of simulating wind and generating wind loads. In connection with the FEM structural analysis software RFEM or the framework program RSTAB, the possibilities can be optimally used. InputThe direct transfer of models from RFEM or RSTAB makes it possible to define relevant parameters of the wind directions to be analyzed with height-dependent wind profiles based on a wind standard. This results in the corresponding load cases with additional globally stored parameters. Without RFEM or RSTAB, RWIND Simulation can be operated manually. For this purpose, the data can be imported from STL vector graphics. The transfer of terrain and surrounding buildings to the simulation is also possible from STL files. Through the exchange between RFEM and RSTAB and RWIND Simulation you can easily use the results of the wind analysis as load cases in your usual working environment of RFEM or RSTAB.

The presentation of the result values is too imprecise. Where can I set that I see more result values for the strut section sizes?,"In the ""Global calculation parameters"" there is the setting ""Number of member divisions for result curves"". By default, this value is set to ""10"". If rods of widely differing lengths are used in a model, the default value of ""10"" is too small. This then manifests itself, for example, in the fact that the parabolic moment curve is not displayed correctly for the shorter members. To work around the problem, a higher value can e.g. ""50"" can be entered. This will also a parabolic moment curve is shown on the shorter bars. The length of sections results from the length of the longest bar in the system divided by the set number of bar sections. The finer staff division applies to all staffs of the model. "
The welds of the post head plate are very small. How can this be justified?,"From the formula apparatus of EC 3-1-8 it can be seen that the limit tensile forces of the end plate of the beam are introduced into the column flange and from there directly into the column web. The upper end plate is therefore not fully stressed by these forces. The column head plate is there for purely structural reasons for the reinforcement and buckling field limitation and, in the case of a required diagonal stiffener, serves to transfer the proportionate force that flows into this stiffener."
"I would like to check the punching shear of a column with connected beams as a wall corner or Carry out wall end. However, the module uses an internal support. Can this be customized?","RF-PUNCH Pro tries to automatically recognize the correct geometry of the punching point from the model input and to specify it correctly. Depending on the input, it may be necessary to adjust the default geometry. For example, because a column is recognized instead of a punching analysis at a wall corner. This is possible in the input mask 1.5 so that the correct punching geometry can be selected if required. "
How can the determined load increase factors ß from the calculation in RF-PUNCH Pro be displayed graphically?,"You will find a setting for this in the result navigator of the results from RF-PUNCH Pro. Optionally, you can set in the Show navigator that the result should be displayed in the form of isolines. "
When should the punching load be determined with the smoothed and when with the non-smoothed profile of the shear forces in the critical perimeter?,"No general recommendation for action can be given for this. As a user, you can initially retain the default setting ""Unsmoothed shear force over the course of the critical perimeter"" for the wall corners and wall ends. After the calculation, the course of the shear force in the critical perimeter can be checked graphically. Optionally, if required (e.g. with occurring singularities) are switched to ""smoothed"". It should be noted, however, that any singularities that may occur are also included in the beta calculation. It may then also be necessary for the load increase factor ß to be specified directly by the user."
How can further tables be added or tables removed in the printout report?,"The content of the printout report can be changed in the ""Printout report selection"" dialog. In the open printout report, the dialog is opened via the Edit → Selection menu, the corresponding icon in the toolbar or the printout report context menu. called. The dialog can also be opened without opening the printout report via the context menu in the project navigator - data The chapters that are to appear in the printout report can be selected in the global selection. If an entry is deactivated here, the associated detail tab also disappears. In the tabs Model data, Load cases and combinations, Loads and Results, the corresponding tables can then be selected in the ""Tables to be shown"" section.Moreover, chapters in the open printout report can be deleted via the context menu. To do this, select the relevant chapters and then select the ""Remove from report"" command from the context menu. The chapter(s) can be inserted via the ""Printout report selection"" dialog."
Can solids made of concrete also be designed with the add-on modules for RFEM?,"In RFEM, surfaces and members made of reinforced concrete can be designed. Members are designed in the add-on module RF-CONCRETE Members or RF-CONCRETE Columns.Surfaces are designed design in the add-on module RF-CONCRETE Surfaces (optionally with RF-CONCRETE Deflect or RF-CONCRETE NL). Solid bodies made of reinforced concrete cannot be designed in RFEM. There is currently no module for the reinforced concrete design of solids. However, you can create solids with the material ""concrete"" and here e.g. B. determine the stresses within the solid. Optionally, a result member can be inserted into the volume, with which the results of the solid can be converted into member section sizes. The result member can then be exported to RF-CONCRETE Members or Design RF-CONCRETE Columns."
How can I determine the breakdown load of a system with a breakdown problem?,"There is currently no direct way to determine the puncture load. It is important that there are several different states and therefore several local breakdown loads.You can provide a system with load levels and then view the individual load levels and thus (depending on the number of load levels) find a load factor close to a breakdown.In the attached model, 20 load levels and saving of the intermediate results have been set. Load level 10 is shown as the last load level before the breakdown and the first load level after the breakdown, recognizable here by the significantly higher deformation."
How can I transfer a softlock network license to another server?,Below is a PDF file with detailed instructions to transfer the virtual dongle to another server.
Is it possible to adjust the notch cases or the tension play of the notch cases manually?,"You can control the notch cases in the ""1.3 Cross-section"" input dialog and the ""Edit notch cases"" detail dialog. The default standard values can be selected here. It is not possible to adjust these values manually. "
What is the meaning of the stiffness reduction coefficients k33 and k88 in RF-LAMINATE?,"These factors reduce the torsional stiffness D33 and the shear stiffness D88 of the corresponding elements of the stiffness matrix of a surface. Since cross-laminated timber is not usually glued on the narrow sides, no shear stresses can be transferred to the narrow sides of the board. Thus, the stiffness would be overestimated in this case. For this reason, the rigidity must be reduced accordingly. Some manufacturers have already given us these values when they sent us the layer structures. These then result from internal investigations. Help for determining the correction factors is presented in [1]. The investigations of this work have also been introduced in the Austrian Annex to EN 1995-1-1[2] . The ratio of board width (a) to board thickness (ti) can be found in the corresponding approval. Under ""Downloads"" you will find an Excel file with the stored formulas."
"When calculating with RF-CONCRETE Deflect, can the distribution coefficient ζ also be defined manually? So that this should always be at least 0.5?","No, unfortunately this is not possible. If the ""Tension Stiffening"" option is not used in the calculation, the distribution coefficient ζ becomes either ""0"" for ""uncracked"" or to ""1"" for ""torn"". See also the technical article linked below on communicating the distribution coefficient ζ. But the manual specification of e.g. E.g. ζ = 0.5 is not possible."
Which concrete tensile strength is taken as a basis for the transition from state I to state II? fctm or fct;0.05?,"The concrete tensile strength fct,eff,wk = fctm x crack width factor is applied."
Is it possible to display the curvature of the ceiling or the radius of curvature of the ceiling in the element nodes?,"No, unfortunately this is not possible."
"In a nonlinear system, some load cases do not converge. The load combinations, on the other hand, can be calculated without any problems. What could be the cause for this?","When defining non-linearities, such as failure of a bearing under tension, it can happen that some load cases cannot be calculated. If these are loads that cannot occur at all without other stabilizing loads, the solution to the problem is simple: You can set the load cases to ""Not to be calculated"". As a result, only the load combinations are calculated in the ""Calculate all"" calculation process. This is possible because, for example, some loads can never occur without their own weight. In the attached example it is easy to see that the system would tilt in the wind load case and therefore no convergence was found becomes. In contrast, the load combination in which self-weight and wind are combined can be calculated without any problems, since self-weight stabilizes the system. "
Can you import the buckling lengths from RF-STABILITY or RSBUCK into RF-/TIMBER Pro?,"Yes, that is possible. First of all, you can use RF-STABILITY (or RSBUCK in RSTAB 8) to determine the buckling lengths for a system and a specific load. These can then be imported into RF-/TIMBER Pro in the ""Effective Lengths"" dialog. "
How can I open an RSTAB 8 file in RSTAB 7?,"To do this, use the ""Open"" command in the ""File"" menu in RSTAB 7. In the ""Open"" dialog, you cannot initially see the RSTAB8 files, since only files for the program versions RSTAB 7 (and older) are displayed. To be able to see all files (including the RSTAB 8 files) in a specific directory or folder, you must change the file type to ""All files"" in the lower area of the dialog. Then you will also see the newer files for RSTAB 8 and can open them in RSTAB 7. Important: We do not guarantee compatibility when opening an RSTAB 8 file in RSTAB 7. It is therefore possible that the file or the model contained in it will be damaged. The module data and the results are also deleted. The same The procedure is also possible in RFEM 4."
How can edgewise lamellas be taken into account in a beam made of glued laminated timber?,"In the main program RFEM/RSTAB, a member rotation of 90° is required first, so that the lamellas of the glued laminated timber beam are on edge. So that the Since the edgewise position of the beam is also taken into account in the design in the RF-/TIMBER Pro add-on module, the increase in strength for edgewise bending stress must be activated within the parameters of the national appendix in the ""Other settings 2/2"" tab. "
Is it not possible to create a second design case in RF-LAMINATE?,"No, unfortunately this is not possible. The layer structure is assigned to certain surfaces in RF-LAMINATE. The respective surface then receives the stiffness defined by this layer structure for determining internal forces in RFEM. If you want to perform a calculation with different layer structures, you have to do this in a copy of the file (another model with a different Build layers)."
Where can the direction of the individual reinforcement layers be seen in RF-PUNCH Pro?,The reinforcement direction phi 1 and phi 2 is shown in dialog 1.4 if you click on one of the cells.
Is it possible to display or export only specific results over time from the time history calculation in RF-DYNAM Pro - Forced Vibrations?,The time course monitor allows you to view all results over time. Here it is also possible to select several parts of the structure and then export the results directly to Excel. 
"What are the dimensions ""Length"" and ""Placing width"" of the longitudinal reinforcement in RF-PUNCH Pro? Is anchorage length included?","The required length of the longitudinal reinforcement or the placement width is defined as follows in the program in RF-PUNCH Pro. For the length of the longitudinal reinforcement:Case 1 - no punching shear reinforcement required: length of longitudinal reinforcement = 2*lw,krit + column widthCase 2 - punching shear reinforcement required: length of longitudinal reinforcement = 2*lw,out + column widthThe following is used for the laying width of the longitudinal reinforcement:Case 1 - no punching reinforcement required: layout width = 6*d + column widthCase 2 - punching shear reinforcement required: layout width = max value from [(6*d + column width) OR (2*lw,out + column width)]An anchorage length of the longitudinal reinforcement is not calculated by the module and must also be taken into account by the user."
"After downloading the installation file, an error message appears when executing that the setup file is defective, what can I do.","If this error occurs, the download was not completed correctly. Please download the program again. Please note that the file can only be executed after the complete download."
Is it also possible to graphically display the intermediate values or design details from the calculation in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces?,"No, unfortunately this is not possible. The intermediate values from the calculation (e.g. the applied static height d for the shear force verification) are available when the ""Design details"" dialog is opened. only available for the selected FE node or grid point. But not for all FE mesh nodes of the designed surfaces. Therefore, these intermediate values cannot be used for a graphic representation on the model, but only in tabular form in the design details ."
How can I evaluate the internal forces of a specific FE node in RFEM?,First you need to determine the location of the FE node. The easiest way to do this is via [Edit] - [Find by number]. The found FE node can then be defined by manually setting the result value . The attached video explains the process.
"When checking the cross-section of a flat steel, I get unusually high shear stresses from torsion in the STAHL EC3 add-on module, which can be refuted using a simple manual calculation. Where is the mistake?","It is very likely that the error lies in the selection of the cross-section:For a steel design, a thin-walled flat steel cross-section should be selected instead of a rectangular solid cross-section. The reason for the high shear stress in a solid cross-section lies in the existing stress points of the cross-section or the associated thickness of this stress point.In a thin-walled flat steel cross-section there are four stress points in the corners of the cross-section with the associated thickness t = 10 mm. In the case of a solid cross-section, on the other hand, there is another stress point in the middle, where as Thickness t with this type of cross-section the maximum of height h or width b is assumed. In this case, this is the width b of 200 mm. This results in a low torsional resistance moment Wt and a correspondingly high shear stress.As described above, the solution is to select a flat steel within the main program."
"When I open a 3D PDF with Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat, all I see is a blank page with no content. What is the reason?","After opening the PDF file, Adobe's security setting for 3D content takes effect. These must be activated. Once you have trusted the document, a simple click in the model area is enough."
"When starting the project manager according to FAQ 002927, all files are displayed by default. How can I set that only RFEM files are displayed to me without having to click on RFEM each time?","In this case, the project manager must be started from the respective program (RFEM, RSTAB ...). If the project manager is started directly from RFEM, only RFEM files are displayed by default. "
"In the graphic, no information about the displayed result (e.g. internal force My, LC1: self-weight) is output either in the working window or in the printout report. How to activate the output?","In the project navigator - show under ""Results"" the check box ""Header information"" is to be activated so that this information is output."
I modeled a continuous beam. One of the supports should only be effective from a deformation of 10 mm. How can you adjust such a non-linearity?,"At this point it is advisable to define a slip. To do this, the partial effect must be set in the ""Edit nodal support"" dialog box under ""Non-linearity"". In the ""Nonlinearity - Partial Effect"" dialog window, a slip can now be defined in the corresponding area. The adjacent diagram serves as a check. "
How can I import curved bars from the program cadwork or other CAD programs?,"In the program cadwork and many other CAD programs, curved members are described via the outer envelope surfaces. Therefore, a direct import via members is unfortunately not possible. The member must therefore first be imported from the CAD program via the .sat format (Standard Acis Text Format) or via .ifc imported as a surface in RFEM and then changed back to a member.For the .sat format, version 7.0 should be selected in cadwork. Both options for the cadwork program are shown in the attached video."
"In a mixed system of rods and surfaces, I have a frame whose transoms have rod end hinges. The moment curve of the bolts looks strange. What is the reason?","If the beam and the surface are in the same plane, they are firmly connected.Although the end of the bar has a bar end hinge, this is already rigidly connected to the surface in the next FE element and splits with the surface the load transfer via bending. The surface must also have a line hinge so that no clamping moments occur."
How does the asynchronous calculation work via the COM interface?,"The asynchronous calculation is used if a self-created program RFEM or RSTAB is only to be called and continue to work in parallel. Then, when the computation is done, that event is dispatched through a delegate. A C# example in a Visual Studio project can be found in the download area below."
What is the difference between Isotropic Plastic 1D and Isotropic Nonlinear Elastic 1D materials?,"The difference between the two material models is as follows:In the Isotropic nonlinear elastic 1D material model, no plastic deformations are taken into account. This means that the material returns to its original state when it is unloaded.The Isotropic plastic 1D material model, on the other hand, takes plastic deformation into account.For both material models, the non-linear properties must be defined in an additional dialog. When entering by means of a diagram, it is possible for both models to specify a progression after the last step.In the material model 'Isotropic nonlinear elastic 1D', an antimetric input of the stress-strain diagram is possible (different for the positive and negative range), while the 'Isotropic Plastic 1D' model only allows symmetric input."
"What does the ""Division of the members by the nodes lying on the members"" option in the FE mesh settings do?","With the option ""Division of the members by the nodes that lie on the members"" a member is divided internally at the member positions where nodes are located.The system contains two members, member S1 from node 1 to node 2 and member S2 from node 3 to node 4.If the option ""Division of the members by the nodes lying on the members"" is activated, bar S1 is divided internally at node 4. Member S1 is connected to member S2, which can also be seen in the deformation.If the ""Division of members by the nodes on the members"" option is deactivated, bar S1 is not split at node 4. The rod S1 is not connected to the rod S2. The system contains the member S1 from node 1 to node 2. Node 3 lies on the member, on which a nodal load PZ = 50 kN is applied. The nodal load loads the member S1 only in the case when the option ""Division of the members by the nodes lying on the members"" is activated. If the option is deactivated, the member S1 is not subjected to this nodal load."
What is the fastest way to model trapezoidal sheets in RFEM using surfaces?,"Trapezoidal sheets are already available in the RFEM cross-section library. These cross sections are primarily used for stabilization measures in the RF-/STEEL EC3 add-on module and as a template for modeling surfaces. A design as a member is therefore not possible. It is easiest to first model the trapezoidal sheet as a member. This member can then be automatically converted into surfaces. In this way, the geometry is obtained as a surface model. Curved trapezoidal sheets are also possible. If a curved bar is divided into surfaces, it is represented by straight segments. However, if curved lines are to be used, the contour lines can simply be rotated accordingly. The exact procedure can be found in the video."
"The import of a DXF file seems to work at first, but there is no data.What can be the cause?","There can be several reasons for this. One of the reasons may be that the DXF file only contains blocks that first have to be separated using the ""Explode"" function, for example.Another source of problems can be that in RFEM or RSTAB a certain layer is selected for import in the ""ASCII Formats DXF"" tab during import, which either does not exist or does not contain any data. The type of backup in the CAD program can also lead to problems. It is possible to save DXF files in binary DXF format. These have the advantage that the files save approx. 25% in memory size. However, RFEM and RSTAB cannot process them. Therefore, the ASCII format should be selected in the CAD program to save the DXF file. "
used the RF-/DYNAM Pro add-on module to generate the decisive result combinations for the seismic loads. What is the further procedure to be able to carry out a dimensioning of the individual components?,"With the add-on modules Equivalent Loads and Forced Vibrations, result combinations can be created that contain the relevant combinations of seismic loads. In order to be able to carry out a design with these, they must be further combined on the basis of the extraordinary combination. This combination is defined, for example, in EN 1990 Section 6.4.3.4: ${\mathrm E}_{\mathrm d}\;=\;\underset{}{\ sum_{}^{}\;{\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{k,\mathrm{j}}\;+\;\mathrm{P}\;+\;{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{Ed}}}\ ;+\;}\overset{}{\underset{}{\sum{\mathrm\psi}_{2,\mathrm i}\;{\mathrm Q}_{\mathrm k,\mathrm i}}} $ This extraordinary combination must be defined manually in RFEM. It should be noted that (in the case of a direction combination with the 100/30% rule) the two result combinations created from RF-/DYNAM Pro must be added with the ""Or"" condition. This unusual combination can then be used for further design. It is possible to evaluate the relevant internal forces and to read and calculate this combination in the design modules. "
Can a deformation calculation in the cracked state also be carried out for a 2D position in RF-CONCRETE surfaces? ,"In this case, it depends on the verification method and the type of the 2D position. When using the analytical method (RF-CONCRETE Deflect), a calculation in 2D positions is possible. When using the non-linear method (RF-CONCRETE NL), the calculation for 2D XY (uZ/φX/φY) is not possible . In the non-linear calculation, among other things, shrinkage is mapped internally as an expansion load, which is not possible in this type of 2D position due to the limited degrees of freedom.

How can the main load-bearing direction be displayed graphically in RF-LAMINATE?,"Display of the main load-bearing direction in the RF-LAMINATE add-on moduleDuring the input in the RF-LAMINATE module, you have the option of checking the orthotropy direction of each individual layer graphically. To do this, simply place the cursor in the desired line of the corresponding layer. A coordinate system is then displayed in the RFEM model in the area. This is to be interpreted as follows: red axis = x-axis = β-value of the corresponding layer As a rule, the outer layers determine the main bearing direction, which is why it is sufficient to only consider the first layer. The red axis specifies the main bearing direction. Display of the main bearing direction in RFEMHowever, the main bearing direction can also be displayed directly in the be interpreted in RFEM. To do this, the local axis systems of the surfaces can be displayed. The orthotropy direction β refers to the local x-axis of the surface. this means that the main load-bearing direction for the left surface runs from support to support and for the right-hand surface the secondary load-bearing direction. If you now want to change the bearing direction for the right surface, you can either rotate the local surface axis system or create a new structure and rotate the orthotropy direction β there by 90°. If the main load-bearing direction is not clearly evident, it is worth taking a look at the stiffness matrix of the surface. There, the ""strong"" bearing direction can be found, for example, based on the bending stiffness. The element D11 refers to the local x-axis of the surface and the element D22 refers to the local y-axis of the surface. "
Can the structures of manufacturer-specific cross laminated timber panels be saved in the RF-LAMINATE module?,"The superstructures of manufacturers of cross laminated timber products are stored in the central RF-LAMINATE database.

How do I create a frame corner with haunch in JOINTS Steel - Rigid?,"Entering a haunch on a beam is enabled via the Arrangement section. A haunch can be modeled either on the underside or on the upper side of the beam.The sheet thickness and the height of the haunch are defined by selecting a haunch profile, since, for example, rounded rolled profiles are often used. If any sheets are used, a parametric T-section can be selected. The length of the haunch and the material are entered in the same section. The weld thicknesses for connecting the haunch to the beam can be set in the Welds section. If a haunched member is already used as a beam (input in the Nodes and members section using different cross-sections and lengths), no additional haunch can be modeled. "
I have modeled a ceiling slab with a joist that intersects with a continuous column. How can I prevent the slab from not resting on the column but only on the joist?,"To ensure that the ceiling in this situation only rests on the joist, modeling a minimal opening within the ceiling area is a good idea. So that the members or the lines of the members remain integrated in the surface, the ""Connect lines/members"" function must then be used once on the entire model. This ensures that the ceiling panel continues to rest on the beams."
"I use rod end joints with slip in the longitudinal direction of the rod. However, the calculation is always aborted due to an instability message. How can I optimize the system accordingly?","Especially the definition of a slip is a challenge for the equation solver because of the non-linear calculation. In the following, tips are given on how to avoid instabilities. Load stepsWhen considering non-linearities, it is often difficult to find a balance. Instabilities can be circumvented by applying the load in several steps. if e.g. For example, if two load levels are specified, half the load is applied in the first step. Iterate until equilibrium is found. Then, in a second step, the full load is applied to the already deformed system and iterated again until equilibrium is reached. In the case of load levels, it must be remembered that they have an unfavorable effect on the computing time. For this reason, a 1 (i.e. no gradual load increase) is preset in the input field. In addition, for each load case and each load combination, it can be determined separately how many load steps are to be applied. The global specifications are then ignored. Slip definitionUsually, the slip (e.g. in a connection) is determined via the non-linearity "" Partial effect"" defined. There you can define from which joint displacement the forces should be transferred. As you can see in the diagram, the stop, i.e. the rigidity that acts after the corresponding joint displacement, is considered as rigid (vertical branch, see red arrows). Under certain circumstances, however, this can lead to numerical problems in the calculation. To get around this, the stiffness that acts after the joint displacement should be reduced a little. This is achieved by defining a very stiff spring. In addition to the very stiff stop, numerical problems can also occur within the slip. In this case, for the effect of the slip, a small rigidity must be taken into account in order to make the horizontal branch rise a little. The stiffness should be selected so small that it has no decisive influence. This situation is possible using the ""Diagram"" non-linearity. Arrangement of the rod end hingesWhen arranging the hinges, care should be taken that these are not defined in the same direction at both ends of the member. Thus, there is a state in which the rod is not adequately supported and the system fails in the first iterations. In such a case, the slip should be defined on only one side of the member and the size of the slip should be adjusted accordingly. "
How can I check whether my freely variable load was applied correctly?,The load application can be controlled via the Project Navigator -Results → Load Distribution. The load distribution can be represented graphically in sections over the circumference and the height. The course of the load can be clearly seen from the load distribution in the horizontal and vertical sections.
A bar that is apparently not adequately supported does not lead to instability of the entire system. What is causing this?,"The cause can be the definition of member eccentricities. For a better overview, the origin lines are automatically hidden for eccentric members. In some cases it looks as if one end of a member is not sufficiently supported. However, the networked line works in the background. This can be made clear by hiding the members in the Show navigator. For this reason, in this case there is no graphical connecting line that represents the eccentricity. Due to the setting2, the node is still meshed with the vertical bar. To make the graphical connection line visible, the bar or line should be on be shared with this node"
Why are the equivalent member designs grayed out in the Stability tab when you activate the plastic design using the partial internal force method (RF-/STEEL Plasticity)? ,"Since the equivalent member designs of Eurocode 3 have different interactions than the designs based on the partial internal forces method and a mixture of these different types of design is not desired for reasons of clarity, the equivalent member designs are deactivated when using the RF-/STEEL Plasticity extension."

This means that the line segments between nodes 3, 4 and nodes 4, 5 overlap so that the error message is displayed.The order of the nodes must be changed so that no line segments overlap. In this example, the order nodes 1 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 4 would have to be specifiedAlternatively, the polyline can be broken down with the ""Disassemble Polyline"" function. Two lines are then created between nodes 5 and 4. A line is then to be deleted.

How does the material model plastic 1D work?,"Plasticity for 1D elements currently only works in relation to normal stresses in a member. This means that only one interaction between normal force and moment is possible. The shear force interaction is not taken into account. In addition, the stresses from shear forces are only calculated elastically. When using a plastic material model, it is also important to ensure that the elements are divided sufficiently, since a cross section is generated internally at each Gauss point on the bar element , at which the stress is calculated and, if necessary, the stiffness is reduced for internal force redistribution. If, for example, the number of divisions is increased, the model can become unstable because the stresses can no longer be redistributed and the load in the cross-section is too high.It is generally advisable to use a division of ""50"" for bar elements if the plastic material model is used (see picture)."
How can I design a reinforced concrete section in DICKQ?,"The reinforced concrete design in DICKQ must be activated in the general data. As soon as the design is active, settings for the design can be made in a separate tab.

"In the RF-/STEEL EC3 add-on module, I selected two bracings of the same size as the shear panel type for a beam to be designed in the ""Parameters"" window. Accordingly, the wearer should be laterally supported in the middle. Why is the eigenform still arbitrary?","The term ""shear panel"" indicates that the displacement spring, which is created using the type of shear panel and the corresponding parameters over the length of the beam, is smoothed. p>This is also the case with the ""Brace"" shear panel type, so that the mode shape always appears random at this point. In order to achieve precise results at this point, it is recommended to manually define a lateral support using nodal supports according to the general method or to define the effective lengths according to the equivalent member method, including intermediate supports if necessary. This finally creates a natural shape with recognizable lateral support in the center of the span. "
What is the branch load factor and how can it be determined? ,"The critical load factor indicates the factor by which a load can be increased before the system fails. If this is less than one, then a second-order analysis is usually unstable because the system is already stressed above the critical load. This factor is also addressed in standardization. For example, Eurocode 3 specifies that a critical load factor of 10 and above does not require a second-order analysis.The critical load factor can be determined with the RSBUCK or RF-STABILITY module."

How can I calculate a wood-concrete composite floor with cross laminated timber?,"Two flat components can be combined in the module RF-LAMINATE can be defined via the Hybrid material model. Here, it would also be possible to automatically enter a cross-laminated timber panel according to manufacturer specifications. The disadvantage of the input in the RF-LAMINATE module is the requirement for a rigid bond. This is not the case with a wood-concrete composite construction. The calculation is therefore only an approximation. Another possibility is to couple two surfaces via a surface release or a contact volume. The advantage here is almost any thrust transmission to be able to define. In the RFEM model file attached here, this has been defined in the middle second model. The third option would be to define a hybrid member, as is the case in the third model of the attached file has been defined. Here, however, the biaxial load transfer of the construction is not taken into account. However, this method has the advantage of a fairly automated design. This is also explained in this FAQ . "

How to work around the problem?","The ""Split line → Spacing"" option has a fixed minimum limit of 0.50 mm. If a line is to be even shorter (eg 0.25 mm), the line must first be divided to 1.00 mm. Subsequently, three intermediate nodes can be generated using the ""divide line → n intermediate nodes"" function. This gives a line length of 0.25 mm.Important!Each file combines nearby nodes that are closer together than 0.5 mm. In the above case, this is to be adjusted using the ""Extras → Regenerate model"" function."
"For some time I have had display problems in RSTAB and RFEM that make working with the software difficult. It primarily affects the presentation of results. Lines are solid, dotted or not shown at all, depending on how you zoom in or out. Any idea how I can fix this problem?","It might be advisable to try (de)activating the hardware acceleration. In RSTAB and RFEM, the hardware acceleration (OpenGL) can be activated via the "" Options"" → ""Program options"" can be activated or deactivated in the ""Graphics"" dialog tab. In the same dialog, improved smoothing (antialiasing) can also be set to prevent the edge effect. Both options are only activated after restarting the program. Another problem could be that the graphics card driver is out of date. Under certain circumstances, this can lead to problems when using RSTAB and RFEM. I would therefore ask you to update the driver. "
would like to verify flexural buckling for timber components with imperfections and internal forces according to the second-order theory. Is it sufficient to activate this in the details in the add-on module RF-/TIMBER Pro or are further settings necessary?,"The setting only regulates the influence on the design side. After activating this function, the buckling checks in the ""Effective Lengths"" mask are deactivated. Accordingly, only a lateral-torsional buckling analysis is carried out. In order to calculate with the design values of the stiffness, these are to be calculated according to [1 ] to be reduced by the partial safety factor. To do this, activate the marked option in the calculation parameters. If the automatic combinatorics for the EN 1990 + EN 1995 standard were used, then so this setting is automatically activated for combinations for the ULS according to the 2nd order theory. This option is automatically deactivated for combinations for the SLS as well as for combinations that are generated according to the 1st order. However, the automatic assignment only takes place via the calculation type in the ""Combination rules"" mask. Should for the calculation of individual components with the partial safety factor divided 5% quantile value of the stiffness parameters, the ""Modify stiffnesses"" function must also be activated in the calculation parameters and the stiffnesses must be modified manually for this. "
want to renumber faces in groups in my model. How can I do this?,"In the first step, the overall model should be automatically renumbered so that the later numbers are not used.The surfaces can then be selected in groups and given the desired number. Both individual and automatic renumbering can take place."
How can I pass a field with nodes instead of just a node via the COM interface in VBA?,"To transfer multiple elements, you must first create a field (array) in VBA:Dim nodes(0 to 2) as RFEM5.Node You can then transfer the array (here three elements 0,1,2) to all nodes at once using the IModelData.SetNodes() method.These methods are also available for the following structure elements:IModelData.SetLines() IModelData.SetMembers() IModelData.SetSurfaces()"
How can I model a conical mast?,"The cross-section library offers a large number of different cross-sections. The parametric definition option is also available for many cross-section shapes. The video shows how you can use this to easily model a conical mast. If this member is divided, the software automatically determines the new cross-sections at the division points."
"In comparison between the partial calculation of a single floor and the overall calculation of the building, the local deformations are very different. How can that be?","First of all, it should be noted that the local deformations of surfaces are always related to the undeformed system. Therefore, in a multi-storey building, the deformations of the top floor also include the deformations of the lower floors. As expected from this simple model, this is identical for the ceilings. In such a case, the partial calculation of the individual slabs does not pose a problem, since the relative deformation is apparently identical for each slab.However, it becomes problematic if the supporting elements are loaded differently or the rigidity of the supporting ones Elements within a floor is different. It can be seen that the course shows the greatest differences between the lowest ceiling and the highest ceiling. In this specific case, in addition to the corner supports, inner supports with a less rigid cross-section were added. For this reason, the relative deformation in the middle also increases more with each additional floor than at the corner columns.In reality, this system will not exist as the ceilings are manufactured one after the other and the deformations (e.g. B. by its own weight) during construction from ceiling to ceiling. This is therefore a typical structural problem. The question therefore arises as to whether the effects can be neglected or, e.g. B. must be analyzed with the RF-STAGES module. "
Why does RF-CONCRETE Members or CONCRETE determine a significantly higher existing reinforcement than the required reinforcement?,"This can be related to the staggering of the existing reinforcement. If staggering is not activated, a constant reinforcement is laid out over the entire system. The staggering of the reinforcement can be activated in the module in the ""Longitudinal reinforcement"" tab. After activating the staggering, a number of areas can be specified. The higher the number of areas, the more precisely the existing reinforcement can follow the course of the required reinforcement."
How are buckling lengths of frame columns determined in RFEM or RSTAB?,"The easiest way to do this is to use the RSBUCK (RSTAB) or RF-STABIL (RFEM) add-on modules. RSBUCK and RF-STABIL perform an eigenvalue analysis for the Complete model with a certain normal force state. The normal forces are increased iteratively until the critical load case occurs. In the numerical calculation, this stability load is characterized by the fact that the determinant of the stiffness matrix is zero. If the critical load factor is known, the buckling load and the buckling figure are determined from it. The buckling lengths and buckling length coefficients are then determined for this lowest buckling load. As a result, depending on the required number of eigenvalues, the critical load factors with the associated buckling figures and for each member eigenform a buckling length around the strong and weak axis. Since each load case usually has a different axial force state in the elements, there is a separate associated buckling length result for each load situation the frame support. The buckling length at whose buckling figure the column buckles in the corresponding plane is the correct length for the verification of the respective load situation. Since this result is due to the different load situations in each analysis can be different, for a verification - to be on the safe side - one assumes the longest buckling length of all calculated analyzes for all load situations. Example for Manual calculation and RSBUCK / RF-STABILA 2D frame with a width of 12 m, a height of 7.5 m and articulated supports is given. The support cross-sections correspond to an I240 and the frame beam to an IPE 270. The supports are subjected to two different concentrated loads. l= 12 mh = 7.5 mE= 21000 kN/cm²Iy,R= 5790 cm^4 Iy,S= 4250 cm^4 NL = 75 kNNR= 50 kN $EI_R=E\ast Iy_R=12159\; kNm^2$$EI_S=E\ast Iy_S=8925\;kNm^2$ $\nu=\frac2{ {\displaystyle\frac{l\ast EI_S}{h\ast EI_R}}+2}=0.63$ This results in the following critical load factor: $\eta_{Ki}=\frac{6\ast\nu}{(0.216\ast\nu^2+1)\ast(N_L+N_R)} \ast\frac{EI_S}{h^2}=4.4194$ The buckling lengths of the frame supports can be determined as follows: $sk_L=\pi\ast\sqrt{\frac{EI_S}{\eta_{Ki}\ast N_L}}=16,302\;m$ $sk_R=\pi\ast\sqrt{\frac{EI_S}{\eta_{Ki}\ast N_R}}=19.966\;m$ The results from the manual calculation agree very well with those from RSBUCK or RF-STABILITY. RSBUCK$\eta_{Ki}=4,408$$sk_L=16,322\;m$$sk_R=19,991\;m$ RF-STABLE$\eta_{Ki}=4.408$$sk_L=16.324\;m$$sk_R=19.993\;m$"
Can you also consider friction at a nodal support in RFEM or RSTAB?,"It is possible to consider friction for the translation at a nodal support in both RFEM and RSTAB.There are various options that take the different directional components into account. For example, the frictional force for the z-direction can only be calculated from the y-component or only from the x-component, but also from both together or even the addition of the two forces.In addition to the friction coefficient, it is also possible the spring constant can be defined. This determines the behavior of the bearing before the maximum frictional force is reached or before the transition from static to sliding friction. The higher the value of the spring constant, the less the bearing can deform before it switches to sliding friction."
Is it possible to subsequently deactivate the symbols for the FE mesh refinement in an existing graphic in a printout report?,"Yes, this is also possible. If you want to edit a graphic in the printout report later, you can right-click on this graphic and click on the ""Edit"" command. You can then adjust the configuration in the display navigator in this graphic and uncheck ""FE mesh refinement"" and click on ""Back to printout report"" to return to the report. The display of the FE mesh refinement in existing graphics can also be edited. "
"use Microsoft Word for the documentation of my structural calculations. In RSTAB or RFEM I use the ""Print graphics"" → ""Save to clipboard"" option and paste the graphics into Word using ""CTRL+V"". After a few successfully inserted images, however, nothing happens anymore. What is the cause of this and how can I work around it?","This problem is not caused by RSTAB or RFEM, but by the clipboard capacity of Word. When printing the graphics to the clipboard, a maximum resolution of 4000 x 4000 pixels is possible. The maximum image dimension (i.e. height or width) is decisive and the smaller side dimension is scaled down. If there is an almost square graphic that is then to be saved with the maximum resolution, the resulting file size is 4000 * 4000 * 3 = 48,000,000 bytes = 48 MB. Word usually ""remembers"" up to 24 elements in the clipboard. This means that the clipboard capacity of Word can be reached quickly and further images are no longer recorded . In order to be able to insert further graphics into Word, it should be closed and restarted. "
"How can I show some results from all load cases in the printout report, but other results from selected load cases only?","In the general printout report selection, the load cases to be shown for results can only be specified for all result types. However, sometimes it makes sense to differentiate between these settings depending on the result type (for example, support forces should be output from all load cases, but internal forces should only be output from the governing load cases). This can be set with the special selection per result type (right click on the corresponding entry in the navigation tree). On the other hand, all load cases can remain selected in the general selection and then all load case results that are not required are manually removed from the navigation tree. This manual selection can be overwritten in the global settings. The corresponding option ""Overwrite individual settings"" appears here."
Why is the cracking moment Mcr in double bending smaller than in single bending?,"The cracking moment of a concrete cross-section is calculated from the mean tensile strength of the concrete and the ideal section modulus. The crack moment describes the internal size that occurs when the tensile stress fctm is reached in the outermost fiber of the cross-section and the first crack forms. For simple bending, the cracking moment can be calculated analytically. In the case of double bending, the introduction of a weighting factor k is helpful in order to get from the parts Mcr,y and Mcr,z Mcr to be determined. Calculation for the attached example: Bending moment My = 20 kNm Bending moment Mz = 20 kNm Ideal resistance moment Wy = 3081 cm^3 Ideal section modulus Wz = 3081 cm^3^ Mean tensile strength of concrete fctm = 0.290 kN/cm^2 Bar 1: Simple bend My: $\begin{array}{l}M_{cr\;}=f_{ctm}\times W_y\\M_{cr\;}=0.29 \;\frac{kN}{cm^2}\times3081\;cm^3\\M_{cr\;}=893\;kNcm\;=\;8.9\;kNm\end{array}$ Bar 2: Simple bend Mz: $\ begin{array}{l}M_{cr\;}=f_{ctm}\times W_z\\M_{cr\;}=0.29\;\frac{kN}{cm^2}\times3081\;cm ^3\\M_{cr\;}=893\;kNcm\;=\;8.9\;kNm\end{array}$ Bar 3: Double bend My and Mz: $\begin{array}{l}M_ {cr\;}=\sqrt{M_{cr,y}^2+M_{cr,z}^2}\\M_{cr,y\;}=k\times My\\k=\frac{f_ {ctm}}{\sigma_M}\\\sigma_M=\frac{M_y}{W_y}+\frac{M_z}{W_z}=\\\end{array}$ "
recently bought RSTAB with the BETON module. Can I use it to perform a stability analysis of reinforced concrete columns?,"Yes, the CONCRETE module for RSTAB 8 also contains the nonlinear reinforced concrete design. You can then activate the ""Nonlinear design (state II)"" in the ""Ultimate state"" tab. In the detailed settings for the nonlinear design you can then Select the ""General design method for members with second-order pressure"". It is important here that you define the imperfections in RSTAB and for the design Apply load combinations (LC) according to the second-order theory, no result combinations (EC)!Note on RFEM 5:In RFEM 5, the same procedure is possible in RF-CONCRETE Members. However, the RF-CONCRETE NL add-on module is required in RFEM for the non-linear reinforced concrete design."
inserted a result bar over a doorway. Why do the shear forces and moments deviate so much from an ideal single-span beam?,"If the result member is defined correctly, the FE mesh may be too coarse in the door lintel area, which leads to gross inaccuracies in the results (shear forces here). It is recommended to create about ten finite elements on top of each other over the height of the door opening. If the height above the door opening is 0.5 m, for example, a target FE mesh width of 0.05 m is appropriate in this area so that the desired results are achieved (Shear forces). The setting is made globally (Menu → Calculation → FE mesh settings) or using a local FE mesh refinement."
store my objects on a network drive. Does this affect the calculation time?,"No, the calculation time is not affected by this, since the data is copied to the local working directory when it is loaded and is only written back when it is saved. Depending on the connection speed to the server, there may be delays when loading and saving."
"After an update of RSTAB, my .rst files, which are used by another program, are always opened with RSTAB. However, the .rst file does not belong to RSTAB but to another program. How can I regulate the association of the file type?","By default, RSTAB 5 files with the file extension .rst are also opened with RSTAB 8. If you use other software that also works with files that have the file extension .rst, the standard app for this file extension must be assigned in the Windows settings. The procedure can be found in the video. This setting is retained even after an update of RSTAB."
"After the calculation, a circular modeled opening appears as a square.How can I fix this problem? ","The consideration of curved elements depends on the fineness of the FE mesh. An FE element always has straight outer edges. If the FE mesh was chosen too coarsely, the result is a very imprecise mapping of the curved elements straight lines. If the global setting of the desired length of the finite elements under ""Calculation"" → ""FE mesh settings"" is specified with sufficient precision, a local FE mesh refinement can also be carried out on the nodes, lines or surfaces. "
How can I switch off the display of the symbols for the FE mesh refinement?,"You can find the setting for this in the display navigator under ""Model"" and ""FE mesh refinement"". If you remove the checkmark there, then the symbol for the FE mesh refinement will not appear more shown in the structure."
"In the global calculation parameters, the ""Special treatment"" option for members is greyed out and cannot be activated. What is the reason for that?","This option is only available if the structure also contains non-linear structural elements (eg tension members). You can easily check whether this is the case. Open the global calculation parameters and check in the lower left under ""Nonlinearities"" whether the option ""Members due to member type"" or the option ""Member nonlinearities"" is available. If these are greyed out, then there are no bars with these parameters stored and the ""Special treatment"" option is therefore not available, since there will be no missing bars. "
Can I calculate a three-dimensional log house with RFEM?,"The almost realistic representation of a building in construction programs makes many users want to carry out the structural design of a building with the same complex spatial model. Again and again we are also approached with the dimensioning of log houses. Unfortunately, this beautiful construction is relatively expensive for a three-dimensional analysis. There are some critical questions in the dimensioning that cannot be answered. What sorting class are the woods subject to? Damp, unsorted wood is often used in log construction.How is the contact between the woods regulated? Diamond notch, connection with push blocks, etc.?Are buck blocks installed? What type of wood and how is it held horizontally?What are the dimensions of the wood? In log construction, the grown trunk is often used. These trunks do not have uniform dimensions, as nature does not fit into a grid.How can the contact between two layers of wood be taken into account?Furthermore it so that log houses are common for houses with a maximum of 2 full floors due to their high settlement of more than 15cm per floor. The forces occurring here are therefore within a manageable range and can be recorded with sufficient accuracy using the methods of bar statics in 2D systems. For this purpose, RFEM/RSTAB offers the option of defining haunched round bars. The definition of 2D equivalent systems can be done much faster in RFEM/RSTAB. There are some references to this in the specified literature source."
In RF-/STEEL EC3 I get the error message that a node with support does not exist in the set of members. What is the reason?,"In RF-/STEEL EC3, in the ""1.7 Nodal Supports"" window, a support was defined at a node that is not part of the set of members. In this case, a support at an existing node in the set of members must be defined or this nodal support must be deleted in RF-/STEEL EC3 in the ""1.7 Nodal Supports"" window. for example, for the set of members 1 the nodes 2 and 7 are defined as nodal supports. At the start of the calculation, the message ""Node no. 7 with support does not exist in set of members no. 1. Please correct in Table 1.7."".In RF-/STEEL EC3, in the ""1.7 Nodal Supports"" window, you can only display the selected set of members by clicking the ""Show current object"" button and clicking the button ""Local coordinate system"" the node numbering are displayed. Here you can see that node 7 is not included in the set of members. The support is to be defined at a node contained in the set of members (e.g. node 6) instead of at node 7."
How is steel fiber reinforced concrete best taken into account with the structural analysis program RFEM?,"With the add-on module ""RF-MAT NL"", the non-linear material model ""Isotropic Damage 2D/3D"" can be used in RFEM to define the stress-strain curve for the steel fiber reinforced concrete. In the subsequent non-linear FE calculation, the internal forces and the deformation can be determined. The two links in the FAQ contain two interesting technical articles on the subject of steel fiber reinforced concrete."
"Unfortunately, the module results are not visible in the RFEM Viewer.","All RFEM results, including module results in the printout report, are available in viewer mode. However, the following restrictions apply:There are none Calculation, processing and storage, as well as import and export possible. In addition, no modules can be started."
"During the plausibility check, I get the error message that the opposite surface of the contact surface cannot be located. How can I fix this?","When modeling a contact volume, one of the things to note is that the two contact surfaces must be arranged in parallel and be identical. A contact volume is to be created with contact between the upper and lower surfaces . The upper contact area is divided into two areas F2 and F3 and therefore does not correspond to the lower contact area F1. Two contact volumes have to be defined here. The contact volumes can be created, for example, with the ""Create solid with contact"" function. To do this, select the contact surfaces and call up the function of the same name from the context menu. Alternatively, the contact volume can be generated manually. Both procedures are shown in the FAQ explanation video."
Is there a way to output the stresses for a solid model after a dynamic time history analysis?,"In the result tables of the RF-DYNAM Pro module, the stresses for solids are not displayed. In order to be able to output the stresses and internal forces, it is necessary to export the results to a load case or result combination. You can then view the results in a load case or a result combination as usual."
I get an error message that one or more point elements have no material assigned. How can the problem be solved?,"So that the error message no longer appears and the calculation can be started, a material must be assigned to the corresponding point elements as follows: Right click on the overall profile: ""Disassemble profile into elements"", Selection of the corresponding elements or all point elements with the status ""Insert"" using View navigator, since only for these a material can be defined (in contrast to point elements with the status ""Remove"")Assignment of the corresponding material and confirmation with OK, Deactivation of visibilitySelect all elements and right-click on one of the selected elements: ""Profile off create selected elements"""
How can I change the exponential representation of the results to integer representation?,"If the results are not to be displayed exponentially, but as whole numbers, the number of decimal places should be minimized: ""Options"" menu, ""Units and decimal places"". Another option would be to change the unit from, for example, ""mm"" to ""cm"". "
"When designing a rectangular cross-section, I can only select circumferential reinforcement. Why is that?","As soon as there are circular cross-sections in a structure, they can only be designed with circumferential reinforcement. This is because there is no ""top"" and ""bottom"" in a circular cross-section. Only one reinforcement arrangement can be defined in RF-CONCRETE Members for each reinforcement set. If circular cross-section and rectangular cross-section are designed together, only the circumferential reinforcement can be used for all cross-sections. To avoid this restriction, an additional or separate reinforcement set must be defined ."
"When comparing the deformation calculation in the RF-CONCRETE modules and another calculation program, I get different results. What could be causing this?","Differences in determining the deformation in the cracked state can have different causes. The following points should be checked in the event of deviations: Is the same calculation method used? RF-CONCRETE Deflect uses an analytical calculation method according to EN 1992-1-1 7.4.3. RF-CONCRETE NL uses a physically non-linear calculation method. More detailed information on the calculation methods can also be found, for example, in the RF-CONCRETE Surfaces manual under Chapter 2.7 and 2.8. Is the same starting system available? Whether the underlying system is to be regarded as equivalent is best viewed using the results of the linear calculation. The linearly determined deformation of the underlying combination should be approximately the same. Any differences in the linear deformation can increase exponentially in connection with the deformation calculation in the cracked state. Are the same effects taken into account? When making a comparison, make sure that the same ones are used effects such as Creep and shrinkage, for example, are taken into account. Are the same input values available? In connection with the deformation calculation, it should also be checked whether the same input values are available. Above all, it is important to ensure that the applied reinforcement and the lever arm or the concrete cover are the same. If you cannot find the cause after the basic check, please contact our hotline ."
"After I started the program as a full version and worked with it for a while, when I tried to save the file, I got a message that the authorization failed. What is the cause of this and how can I still save my file?","First information first: If the program was started as a full version, it does not jump to demo mode if the license is not found during the calculation or saving process.Es stays in waiting mode until the license is available again. The type of licensing must then be differentiated. Single-user licenseNetwork licenseWith the single-user license, you should check whether the hardlock is on the computer and whether the indicator light at the end of the dongle is visible. If not, another USB port should be used, preferably directly on the computer. With the network license, the problem may have been caused by a disruption in the network connection. In the web-based license interface http://localhost:1947/_int_/devices.html it should be checked whether the license key is available there.

Some of my supports are rotated 180 degrees. How can I rotate the view of the nodal supports?,"The discrepancy is probably due to the rounding differences of the nodes. Please adjust the X node coordinates accordingly. The ""Regenerate model"" function could also be helpful, you can find this under Tools. "
Which file type is used for RSTAB and RFEM?,"The associated file extensions of the respective programs are listed below: .rf5 RFEM 5. rf5t RFEM 5 Trial → Can also be opened on the same PC in the full version.rf4 RFEM 4.rf3 RFEM 3.rfe RFEM 2 .rfx RFEM 5 → table contents are saved in XML format .rs8 RSTAB 8 .rs8t RSTAB 8 Trial → Can also be opened on the same PC in the full version.rs7 RSTAB 7 .rs6 RSTAB 6 .rst RSTAB 5 .rsx RSTAB 8 → Table contents are in XML format saved In addition to these Dlubal-specific file types, the program can generate other file formats."
Which method is carried out with the add-on module RF-/DYNAM Pro - Equivalent Loads?,"The ""Equivalent Loads"" add-on module, like the ""Forced Vibrations"" module, carries out the multimodal response spectrum analysis.Contrary to what the name suggests, the simplified response spectrum analysis is not carried out here, as is the case in e.g of EN 1998-1.The equivalent loads are determined separately for each excitation direction using the following formula:$\begin{Bmatrix}{\mathrm F}_{\mathrm X }\\{\mathrm F}_{\mathrm Y}\\{\mathrm F}_{\mathrm Z}\end{Bmatrix}\;=\;\mathrm\Gamma\;\ast\;\begin{ Bmatrix}{\text u}_{\text X}\\{\text u}_{\text Y}\\{\text u}_{\text Z}\end{Bmatrix}\;\ast\; {\mathrm S}_{\mathrm a}(\mathrm T)\;\ast\;\begin{Bmatrix}{\mathrm M}_{\mathrm X}\\{\mathrm M}_{\mathrm Y }\\{\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{Z}\end{Bmatrix}\;$The differences between the two add-on modules are explained in this FAQ."
Can I get a DXF file of the beam geometry from the RX-TIMBER BSH program?,"Yes, that is possible. The output is located in the File → Export to DXF menu. In order to also output any reinforcement elements, the calculation must first be completed and then the export carried out. Otherwise the reinforcement elements will not be output in the DXF. The elements such as nodes, supports, geometry are written in different layers and can be deactivated in the CAD program as required."
How can I load only a part of a rotationally symmetrical component?,"A free, variable load allows a load to be applied to surfaces that varies in height and circumference. A round container that is only loaded over half of the circumference in the direction normal to the surface. To define a load that varies over the circumference, activate the ""Variable"" option under ""Along the circumference"". The factors for the load, including the angles at which they occur, can then be entered using the associated button. Furthermore, the axis of rotation must be defined. The factor kα creates the reference to the load size p of the initial dialog.Alternatively, the area can be divided into corresponding partial areas. The affected sub-areas can then be loaded with a distributed load.The container was modeled with two sub-areas. A surface load can thus be applied to the container half to be loaded."
Two solution methods are available for the linear time history analysis in the RF‑/DYNAM Pro module. What is the difference between the two?,"The two solution methods ""linear modal analysis"" and ""linear implicit Newmark analysis"" are available.Linear modal analysisThis solution method uses a decoupled system which is based on the eigenvalues and mode shapes of the structure. A defined natural vibration case must be assigned. This method should only be used if a sufficient number of eigenvalues of the structure have been calculated in the natural vibration case. That is, care should be taken to achieve an effective modal mass factor of the overall structure of approximately 1 in all governing directions. If this is not possible, this solution method leads to inaccurate results.Linear Implicit Newmark AnalysisThis is a direct time stepping method which does not require a natural vibration case and requires sufficiently small time steps to obtain exact to achieve results. This method is recommended for complex structures that would require a very large number of mode shapes to achieve an effective modal mass factor of around 1. If a sufficient number of eigenvalues can be guaranteed in the linear modal analysis, both solution methods lead to approximately the same results. The RF-DYNAM Pro manual is recommended for more information on both methods."
have a conical surface where I want the surface load to act projected around the surface. Is this possible?,"Such an input is not possible as a surface load, since there is no load type to let the force act locally on a projected area. In such a case, line loads must be used. These can then be loaded according to the line rotation. The detailed procedure is shown in the video. As can be seen in the video, lines in quadrangle areas have to be integrated manually. Line rotation should also be checked."
In RF-/DYNAM Pro there is Rayleigh damping. How do I determine these coefficients and how are they used?,"The Rayleigh coefficients are mandatory for some solution methods. Since only Lehr's damping values are usually given in the literature, they have to be converted.The following formula is used to convert Lehr's damping values into Rayleigh coefficients: ${\mathrm D}_{\mathrm r}\:=\:\frac12\;\left(\frac{\mathrm \alpha }{{\mathrm \omega }_{\mathrm r}}\;+\;\mathrm\beta\;{\mathrm\omega}_{\mathrm r}\right)$ There are α and β are the Rayleigh coefficients. A system of equations must be set up in which the angular frequencies of the two most dominant eigenmodes must be used. For these two eigenmodes, the structure is then damped with the specified Lehr's damping value. All other eigenmodes of the structure are damped with other values. The curve shows an example for the two natural angular frequencies of 10 and 20 rad/s and a Lehr's damping of 0.015. The conversion tool can also be used for the conversion, which can be opened via the ""Calculate from Lehr's damping..."" button. "
Could you please describe to me where to enlarge the calculated force magnitudes in the working window? These are so small I can't see them. ,Additional [Details] buttons are offered in the display properties for some parameters. You open a new dialog in which e.g. B. the distance or the size of the object can be scaled to the dimensions of the overall model. 
Where are custom profiles stored and how can I access them?,"Cross-sections that are not contained in the cross-section library can be entered in RFEM/RSTAB in two ways. 1. Cross-section programs SHAPE-THIN and DICKQ User-defined cross-sections can be created with the cross-section programs SHAPE-THIN or DICKQ. The SHAPE-THIN or DICKQ profiles can be imported via the cross-section library. To do this, in the ""New cross-section"" dialog, click on the ""Take cross-section from program SHAPE-THIN"" or ""Take cross-section from program DICKQ"" button. The desired profile can then be selected and imported in this dialog. Please note that the profiles must be calculated and saved in SHAPE-THIN or DICKQ before the cross-section values can be read. It is only possible to import each cross-section individually. 2. Creating a user-defined cross-section in RFEM/RSTAB If the manufacturer's cross-section properties are known, they can be created in the cross-section database of RFEM/RSTAB using the option ""Create a new user-defined cross-section"". In contrast to the cross-sections created with SHAPE-THIN or DICKQ, these user-defined cross-sections cannot be designed in add-on modules such as RF-/STEEL EC3, since the information required for the design, such as c/t parts, is missing. The The user-defined profiles can be accessed via the ""Read saved user-defined cross-sections"" button in the cross-section library. The user-defined cross-sections are saved across positions in the EigProf.dat file. These cross-sections are also adopted in the case of a version jump (e.g. from X.19.XXXX to X.20.XXXX). The location of the user-defined cross-section library can be determined via the program options. It is possible to copy a user-defined profile database already created on one workstation and paste it into the respective directory of the other workstation. The user-defined profiles are therefore also available on the other workstation without having to read them in again. "
How can I display a load-deformation diagram for any node of the system?,"load-deformation diagram for any node of a model can be defined within the calculation parameters (button or menu ""Calculation"" → ""Calculation parameters"") as a user-defined calculation diagram and displayed with corresponding results: Setting of the desired load levels or increments within the global calculation parameters, Definition of a user-defined calculation diagram within the ""Calculation diagrams"" tab: selection of the load case, the corresponding node and the result types of the horizontal and vertical axis"
Is it possible to adjust the symbol size in the toolbar in RFEM/RSTAB?,"Yes that is possible, you can change the size by right-clicking next to the symbol area."
I am using the program RFEM or RSTAB for the first time. What's the easiest way to learn how to use it?,"On our website www.dlubal.com you will find valuable tips in the form of PDF files, videos, FAQs or Knowledge base entries. In order to ensure an optimal start, we have set up a page with all the information for beginners. Please follow the links below this FAQ."
I check the cross-sectional characteristics of rolled profiles in SHAPE-THIN and found that there are deviations from the tables when determining the torsional moment of inertia It. How can this be explained?,"When determining the torsional moment of inertia, point elements in the analytical equations for It are not taken into account. Therefore, in the case of cross-sections with pronounced fillets, e.g. For example, a correction coefficient can be applied to roll profiles in order to record the effect of the point elements. This correction factor can be adjusted in the calculation parameters. In addition, the torsional moment of inertia can also be calculated using the FE method, which also captures the effect of point elements and welds. This approach takes a bit more computing time than the analytical calculation."
"In which directions do the member types ""spring"" and ""damper"" have a stiffness?","Members with the member type ""spring"" or ""damper"" only have an axial stiffness, i.e. in the direction of the local x-direction. The flexural stiffness and the stiffness perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the member are negligibly small and are not taken into account in RFEM and RSTAB. If a spring is to be used in the system, it therefore only acts in one direction, in the other two directions (local y and z direction) this type of member must have an additional bearing, otherwise the system becomes unstable. "
Is it possible to divide a free area load by existing lines in RFEM?,"Unfortunately, the possibility is not in the program. Here you only have the option of editing the existing load and redefining it if necessary. "
"When using RFEM, the problem occurs that the font used in the work window is extremely small.",The font size of the title and max/min info can be set in the display properties. This function is accessed via the Options → Display Properties → Edit menu.
Are welded stiffeners also taken into account in the fatigue analysis in KRANBAHN?,"If stiffeners are welded into the crane runway girder, the corresponding notch case according to EN 1993-1-9, Table 8.4, Detail 7 must be taken into account in the fatigue analysis. This is implemented in CRANEWAY by creating additional stress points at the connection point of the stiffeners to the profile. These can be adjusted manually in the settings for the notch cases depending on the geometry of the stiffener. During the fatigue analysis of the crane runway girder, the analysis of the normal stress range in the newly generated stress points is also carried out for the x-points where there is a stiffener. The stiffeners and their welds are not checked separately."
"would like to define lateral supports along the component axis, which sometimes act on the top chord, sometimes on the bottom chord. However, only one position can be selected per bar. How can I generate the input?","In order to provide a component with different supports, it must consist of several members and the design must be carried out using a set of members. Different parameters can then be assigned to the individual members. The procedure can be seen in the video."
How can the calculation time in KRANBAHN be optimized?,"Especially with long crane runways and many cranes, the large number of load combinations can lead to a long calculation time. The following settings have a significant influence on the calculation time: Calculation type for determining the internal forcesFast calculation (calculation of all load combinations according to theory 1st order, then calculation of the relevant load combinations according to the second-order flexural torsion theory)Detailed calculation (calculation of all load combinations according to the second-order flexural torsion theory)For the quick calculation method can therefore be useful for the preliminary design. Aimed for maximum length of the finite elementsThe maximum length of the finite elements generated for the second-order bending torsion calculation can be entered within a range of 100mm to 2500mm. A finer division of the finite elements increases the calculation time significantly.For an optimized calculation time depending on the static system, a reasonable length of the finite elements should be selected. As a rule, eight elements per beam field are sufficient to calculate the deformations with a deviation of less than 5% in relation to the exact solution. Number of load combinationsThe number of load combinations generated can be controlled by setting the step width. When entering the increment, the generated number of crane load positions and load combinations is already displayed as a preview. A small increment leads to many load combinations, which require more time in the calculation. "
What does the warning notice ER061) Smallest magnification factor of the design loads <1?,This message means that the critical load of the system or profile has been exceeded. There are many reasons for this. Inadequate lateral supports have often been defined in the STEEL EC3 module. The profiles used or the structure itself may also not be calculable using the general procedure in EC3. This FAQ provides information for such a case. 
"When opening a file of the RF-/FE-BUCKLING add-on module, the input data is not accepted and the default values are preset. What is the reason?",The RF-/FE-BUCKLING add-on module is not downward compatible. Please open the file with the same version that you used to create the file or with a newer version. Older versions can be downloaded from the link below this FAQ.
The design ratio for the cross-section design differs in the RF-/STEEL and RF-/STEEL EC3 modules. What is the reason?,"Cross-sections that are assigned to class 1 or 2 are designed plastically by RF-/STEEL EC3 by default. In order to be able to compare the results with RF-/STEEL, please activate the elastic design of class 1 and 2 cross-sections in the details of RF-/STEEL EC3.Please also check whether the partial safety factors γ for the resistance of the cross-sections are defined identically in both modules."
Can graphics be blocked in the printout report?,"Yes, this is possible. You can ""lock all images"" in the printout report using a button in the toolbar. In addition, the option ""Lock graphic (without update)"" can be selected directly when printing the graphic in the printout report. A graphic that is already included in the printout report can also be locked later. To do this, simply right-click on the graphic and open ""Properties..."". The ""Lock graphic (without update)"" option can be selected in the ""Graphic printout"" dialog. Locked graphics are marked with a small lock icon in the expression log navigator. "
How can I display the results of the RF-/DYNAM Pro module in the printout report?,"The results of the RF-/DYNAM Pro add-on modules Forced Vibrations, Non-linear time history and Equivalent loads are not listed directly in the printout report. This is generally due to the fact that a large amount of data and results are generated in dynamic calculations. In each of the modules mentioned, you have the option of combining a result with the enveloping results create. In this generated result combination, you can view the same results as in the main programs and display them as usual in the printout report. You can also use the usual Print images in the printout report. You also have the option of displaying the progression of time graphically in the printout report."
How many divisions does a member have to have for the calculation in RFEM so that I get exact results? ,"There is no general answer to this question because it depends on the system. There are several divisions to consider in RFEM. 1. Member divisions for result tablesThe member divisions for result values can be created via ""Insert → Model data → ""Member divisions"". This division ensures that, for example, the internal forces of the members are also output at intermediate points in the RFEM result tables The graphical output remains unaffected. 2 the graphical result curve and the determination of extreme values can be viewed and influenced in the FE mesh settings. For rope, bedding , haunched bars or bars with plastic properties, the number of internal divisions can be specified. These result in a real division of the bar by intermediate nodes. This setting has no effect, however, if a bar is placed on the boundary line of a surface or a FE mesh refinement for the definition line is available. With the Members option in Theory III. The order or breakdown problem can also be divided internally for the calculation according to Theory III. Divide order by intermediate nodes to capture these staves with higher accuracy. The number of member divisions is taken from the input field above. If the division also takes place for straight members that are not integrated into surfaces, FE nodes are created on all free members generated and taken into account in the calculation according to the 1st or 2nd order theory. The FE length is either taken from the global mesh size lFE of the Basic section or specified manually. With the option Division by the nodes that lie on the members, FE nodes are created at the member positions where end nodes of other members are located without there being a connection between the members."
Is it also possible to enter stepped reinforcement in RF-CONCRETE Columns?,"No, this is not possible. A member or a set of members is checked as a ""component"" with the model column method.This means that the longitudinal reinforcement over the entire length of the component is constant. The check is carried out with the relevant internal forces at the relevant point of the component (member or set of members). In RF-CONCRETE Members (RFEM) or CONCRETE (RSTAB), a stability analysis with a reinforcement graded over the column is possible via the non-linear design for compression members."
I have imported a SHAPE-THIN cross-section into RSTAB/RFEM. How can I update the cross-section in RSTAB/RFEM if I have changed the cross-section in the SHAPE-THIN program?,"The changed cross-section must be imported again into RSTAB/RFEM. To do this, click on the ""Accept cross-section from SHAPE-THIN program"" button in the ""Edit cross-section"" dialog and select the changed SHAPE-THIN cross-section. The query as to whether the cross-section should be overwritten must be answered with ""Yes""."
I get uplift bearing forces even though the loads act in opposite directions. How can that be?,"First of all, it should be checked in which direction the dead weight of the structural elements acts. You can also display the self-weight graphically using the ""Show navigator"". It often happens that the user does not convert the data when switching the global Z-axis in the calculation parameters and then only adjusts the geometry. The self-weight then acts in the wrong direction and must be provided with the correct sign in the load case."
Which calculation method is the stability analysis in RF-CONCRETE Columns based on?,The add-on module RF-CONCRETE Columns uses the model column method with nominal curvature or nominal curvature method according to EN 1992-1-1. You can find more information about the performance characteristics of RF-CONCRETE columns on the Product homepage via the following link. See links below.
"The design criterion for VEd/VRd,c is output as decisive, although a shear reinforcement is to be designed. In addition, the proof of VEd/VRds is missing. Why is that? ","In the module, the shear force verification is performed in the following order: 1. VEd/VRd,c 2. VEd/VRd,max 3. VEd/VRd,s In the course of VEd/VRd,max, the strut inclination is determined iteratively and in the course of VEd/VRd,s the amount of reinforcement is determined iteratively. If the verification VEd/VRd,max is not fulfilled, the subsequent verification VEd/VRd,s is not performed and the verification criterion VEd/VRd,c is output . "
Why is it that a free load is not fully applied?,"In contrast to normal surface or nodal loads, a free load is defined via an area of influence and influenced elements. By definition, the free load is applied only to the areas of the selected elements that are within this sphere of influence. A free load is defined by absolute coordinates, independent of the elements of the model. For input, these can be conveniently specified by selecting model nodes, but there is no link to the selected nodes. If the model is then moved, for example, the free load remains in its assigned position. If an imperfection generated by RF-IMP is used as a pre-deformed FE mesh, so the free loads are applied to this deformed structure. This can then possibly be outside the sphere of influence and does not receive any load. If the load is to be linked to the structure and also to be displaced in the case of displacements and generated imperfections, standard loads must be used. Alternatively, the area of influence of the free load can be increased as desired in order to still load the entire structure. The applied load can be easily checked by displaying the load distribution in the project navigator - results. "
"During the installation, I get the message from the installation wizard that another installation is currently being carried out and the current installation cannot be continued as a result. What should I do?","Make sure that no scheduled installation is currently running. In the task manager, this can be displayed as an active app and as a background process with the name ""Windows Installer"".If a Windows Installer is also displayed in the task manager after restarting the computer, it can be selected and with the button "" End task"".The desired installation can then be carried out."
"Can free loads (such as free point loads, free line loads, etc.) be transferred using the IFC interface?","Free loads (such as free point loads, free line loads, etc.) cannot be transferred using the IFC interface."
Is there an easy way to create a 3D structure from a 2D model where nodes are extruded into columns and lines into walls? ,"For lines, such an option is already directly accessible in the context menu. For extruding nodes into members and lines into surfaces, this is also possible in the detail settings of copy/rotate/mirror. As soon as at least one copy is created, the new elements are also created.If this function is no longer required, it should be deactivated again in the detailed settings."
Can files created with SHAPE-THIN 8 be opened in older program versions such as SHAPE-THIN 7?,"The files created with SHAPE-THIN 8 cannot be opened in older program versions such as SHAPE-THIN 7. In SHAPE-THIN 8, files cannot be saved in a file format that older versions such as SHAPE-THIN 7 can read.However, the input data can be exported to Excel in SHAPE-THIN 8 and after adjusting the column arrangement in SHAPE-THIN 7 to be imported. This is also shown in the video."
Can profiles created with older program versions of SHAPE-THIN be read and edited in SHAPE-THIN 8?,"Profiles that were created with the following program versions can be opened in SHAPE-THIN 8: SHAPE-THIN 5.xx, SHAPE-THIN 6.xx, THIN-THIN 7.xx,THIN-THIN 7.5x andTHIN-THIN 8.xxThe profiles can be opened from the project manager (Illus. 1) or via the menu File → Open (Illus. 2). Profiles from the DOS versions SHAPE-THIN 1.xx and SHAPE-THIN 2.xx cannot be read into SHAPE-THIN 8."
"In a section through a surface, result curves are not output in the entire area of the section. What is the reason?","If the intersection was defined on an unused line, activate the ""Integrate unused objects into the surfaces"" check box in the FE mesh settings. In FIgure, a section is defined at lines 7 and 12. Line 7 has no further function for area 1. This is not the boundary of Area 1, nor does it have a bearing or load. In the FE mesh settings, the ""Integrate unused objects into the surfaces"" check box is deactivated so that no result curves are output on line 7. Line 12, on the other hand, is loaded so that the result curves are displayed on this line. If the ""Integrate unused objects into the surfaces"" check box is activated, the result curves are also displayed on line 7.If the section runs through several surfaces, the surfaces concerned are listed in the section ""On surfaces no. "" to specify. In the section ""At surface no."" only area 3 is specified, so that result curves are only output for this area. Face 4 would be in the ""To Face No."" to be specified so that result curves are also displayed here."
"I imported a DXF file into RFEM. Unfortunately, the scaling of the model is wrong, it has to be reduced. How do I change the scale?","Settings for data exchangecan be made in the ASCII format DXF (*.dxf) dialog register. Some parameters should be checked, especially before importing. An incorrect unit of length may have been set. In this case, the units of length must be checked and the desired unit of length set."
What is the best way to transfer force between volumes and surfaces?,"Since a surface is a 2D element and therefore the transition from surface to volume is a line, singularities can occur here. It is precisely the moments my and mx that lead to problems.The best way to make the transition is to use rigid bars.In this variant, the rigid bars cover the height/thickness of the surface and thus ensure that the moment is introduced cleanly into the volume. In addition, the rigid rods must also protrude into the surface, half the surface thickness was selected as the depth. The model without the rigid rods shows a large deformation, showing the effect. The model with the rigid bars, on the other hand, shows somewhat the same deformation as the pure surface or volume model."
received a model with a multi-part curved line design. How can I make a single line out of this?,"First, the individual lines must be removed, as it is not possible to merge the partial lines into one overall line. If there are only a few nodes, they can be selected one after the other when defining the line. In order for a selection with a selected area to work in a system with many nodes, it is important that the numbering is continuously increasing or decreasing. If necessary, automatic numbering should be carried out. "
I exported the deformed form to a DXF file after form finding and realized that the results of the DXF file do not match those of RFEM. What is the reason?,"The deformations of load cases and load combinations always refer to the deformed shape of the form-finding and thus to the shifted FE mesh. In this case the result is stored in the ""DL_LK_DEFORMATION u"" layers. The ""DL_FE_MESH"" layer reflects the result of the form finding. The initial structure is located in the ""DL_TOPOLOGY"" layer. Was the DXF file generated with the ""Form-finding"" load case active, i.e. not via a load case or via a Load combination, the deformation to the original structure can be found in the ""DL_FE_MESH"" layer. However, this only applies to surfaces. The deformations in the ""DL_LK_DEFORMATION u"" layers are not of interest in this case and should be hidden. If the structure consists purely of bars/cables, you can use no shape can be exported for the active load case ""Form finding"". This currently only works for surfaces. In order to nevertheless export the found shape of the members, please create an empty load case, have it calculated and then export the results of this load case. The shape can then be found in the ""DL_LF_DEFORMATION u"" layer. Basically, the display factor should be set to ""1"" when exporting the deformed structure . If a larger or smaller factor is defined, this also affects the result in the DXF file."
"Are there model limits in terms of file size? File size (with FE mesh, results and printout report) greater than 4 GB?","If you are using a 64-bit system and the 64-bit version of RSTAB 8 or RFEM 5, there is no file size limit in the program. The ""limit"" is this is determined by the computer configuration. It can happen that the available main memory plus the virtual memory defined in Windows (free memory space) is not sufficient. In this case, the computer configuration can be optimized (more RAM, more free hard disk space)."
"The graphic of the load in the printout report shows me very small load arrows. In the work window, however, they are displayed sufficiently large. How can I also enlarge this for the printout report?","First of all, it is important to ensure that the enlargement of the load arrows in the display properties is also set for the printout report. The arrow sizes can be set between the values 3 to 8. If no improvement is achieved despite changing to the maximum value and reloading the printout report, the graphics driver and printer driver should be updated. "
"We received a NET softlock and also successfully activated it on the license server. However, after the programs have been installed on the user PCs, the ""Authorization"" dialog box appears when the program is called up. If I select the ""Run full version"" option there and refer to the authorization file, I get the message that the license is already activated. What should I do?","If no authorization file is used on the computer, the program tries to activate the softlock again. However, since this is already active, the corresponding message appears. There are two ways to use the already activated license on the clients.In the ""Authorization"" dialog box, select the ""Demo version"" option and read it in as follows: Help --> Authorization --> Read authorization fileRename the AUTHOR.ini to AUTHORE.ini and save it in the directory C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\Global\General Data"
"After converting a CAD/BIM object into a member, the CAD/BIM object has disappeared. Was this deleted during the conversion?","The CAD/BIM objects are not deleted when converted to a member, they are only hidden. In the project navigator, you can show the automatically hidden objects again at any time. I'll show you how this works in a short video."
My goal is to mesh a circular hole plate in alignment. Is such a meshing possible in RFEM?,"With the help of the FE mesh refinement, the program also offers the option of creating an aligned FE mesh. The automatic FE mesh generator can thus be controlled to a certain extent. However, a predefined network geometry cannot be set with this."
Can a design in RF-CONCRETE surfaces also be carried out without additional reinforcement?,"Yes, this is possible. To do this, in the ""1.4 Reinforcement"" input dialog, in the ""Longitudinal reinforcement"" tab, check the box next to ""Use required reinforcement for the serviceability limit state analysis"". Thus, the module lays the entire reinforcement, which is required for the limit state check of the Load-bearing capacity and/or serviceability is required in a reinforcement layer. The ""Additional reinforcement"" results are not output here after the design in the results masks in the module and in the printout report. The option ""Use required reinforcement for serviceability limit state design"" can be combined with the option ""Automatically increase required longitudinal reinforcement for serviceability limit state design"" "
How can a factored combinatorics of the dead load in connection with the form-finding take place?,"The load from the form-finding load case (FF) is applied to the system 1.0 times. If the dead load is to be factored in connection with the combinatorics, a permanent load case for the dead load with a 0.35-fold load can also be generated."
"According to DIN 1054, a permissible base stress ""Sigma_zul"" was entered when verifying the base stress. A ""characteristic value"" should be entered in RF-FOUNDATION Pro. How do the two approaches of DIN 1054 and EN 1997-1 fit together?","This discrepancy often results from the switch from DIN 1054 to EN 1997. In the ""old"" DIN 1054, the verification was done with characteristic values on the action side and an allowable stress on the resistance side guided. The actions were treated here without partial safety factors and compared with a specific allowable stress. The safety ""eta"" was completely included in the permissible stress. In the predecessor module of RF-FOUNDATION Pro, which still measured according to DIN 1054, there was There is a separate tab ""Bearing capacity verification (working loads)"". In the Eurocode, the bearing capacity verification is performed in a different way.Here the A partial safety factor is applied to both the action and the resistance side. This increases the load by a factor of 1.35 or 1.5 and reduces the resistance by a factor of 1.4. Related to the ""old standard "", the safety ""eta"" is completely included in the ""permissible stress sigma_zul"". The download link (see below) contains a model file for RFEM or RSTAB included, with which the problem in RF-/FUND or RF-/FUND Pro is illustrated. In this case, the verification was not carried out via the user-defined input of the base pressure, but with the permissible stresses from the standard case tables. The same soil should result in approximately the same foundation dimensions for the Eurocode and for the old standard. The following assumptions for the subsoil were made in the two modules:Cohesive soilPure silt - ULStiff consistency Embedment depth of the foundation t = 1.50 m When using the permissible base resistance according to DIN EN 1997-1 from the standard case tables, the factor 1.4 is already included. The basic values Sigma-R,d(B) of the base resistance differ in comparison to the permissible base pressure ""sigma_zul"" (DIN 1054) by a factor of 1.4. Results of the comparison: Bearing failure analysis according to DIN 1054 in RF-/FUND (old): Bearing failure analysis according to EN 1997-1 in RF-/FUND Pro: Despite different input values, the results from DIN 1054 and EN 1997-1 are comparable. If you look in RF-/ FUND If you want to recalculate a foundation that has already been dimensioned with RF-/FUND (old), you would have to apply the base stress Sigma_R,k twice: Sigma_R, k (input in RF-/FOUNDATION Pro) = 1.40 (partial safety factor for heave) x 1.35 (safety on the load side in the example) x Sigma_zul (from RF-/FOUNDATION (old)). In the attached file this was done in both modules in FA2. Here, 220 kN/m² was specified as the permissible base pressure in RF-/FUND. 416 kN/m² was specified in RF-/FUND Pro. "

"Why is the button with the ""Design Details"" not active in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces?","The ""Design details"" button is only active or selectable if the required reinforcement has been selected from the ultimate limit state (ULS). As soon as the relevant reinforcement from ULS and SLS or only SLS is shown in the result tables, the ""Design details"" button is grayed out. The design details for the serviceability limit state can be selected in Tables 3.1 - 3.3. "
"When I compare RF-CONCRETE Columns and another design program, I get different results. How can the differences be explained?","It is difficult to enumerate one or specific reasons for the deviations. Basically, the design in RF-CONCRETE Columns is an analytical method, the nominal curvature method according to EN 1992-1-1 5.8.8. One advantage of this is that it is a standardized procedure and that all intermediate values of the calculation are output in the module. The cause of a deviation can be identified with the help of the intermediate values between different design programs. If you cannot find the cause, please contact our hotline. In this context, however, we need an expression, including the input and intermediate values, from the program used for the comparison."
"Is there a way to assign arbitrary keyboard shortcuts to certain commands (e.g. copy to clipboard, etc. )?","Frequently used functions and commands are accessible via already implemented keyboard functions. For example, if you want to print a graphic, the associated shortcut is [Ctrl]+[P].For the full list of keyboard functions, see the attached Link.If no dialog is active, the [Enter] key calls up the last used function. This facilitates z. B. setting model or load objects again in the working window."
"Is it possible in RFEM to define a global polar grid whose origin is, for example, in the global zero point and that applies to several surfaces?","In RFEM it is possible to define an area grid for the result output. The grid can be related locally to the area or to a global point in the coordinate system. This makes it possible to relate the grid to the same origin for each area. However, this setting must be defined individually for each area.The procedure is illustrated in the video."
"During installation I get the message ""Failed to install hardlock.cat signature"".How to fix this?","The license drivers are digitally signed. If you try to install a new license driver that is missing from the existing signature of your operating system, a corresponding message will appear. To fix this problem, please perform a Windows update. After restarting the operating system, the installation should run."
Can a model with a pile foundation be designed in RFEM?,"Yes, it is possible. A structure model can be provided with a pile foundation in RFEM.Thus, the influence of the foundation stiffness can be simulated very well on the actual structure. It should be noted, however, that Dlubal Software currently does not offer any solutions for the design of pile foundations.This also means that the user must know the pile resistance in advance. This cannot be done in RFEM, e.g. This can be calculated, for example, by defining a soil structure. The piles can be used as beams, e.g. B. can be modeled with a circular cross-section.The resistance of the piles can be realized by entering a bar bedding or a nodal support at the end of the pile. The design of the beam can then be carried out in the RF-CONCRETE Members module. However, it should be noted that only the relevant standards for building construction are implemented in RF-CONCRETE Members. So e.g. B. DIN EN 1992-1-1."
"Why do I get a discontinuous area in the course of the internal forces? In the area of a supported line, I get a jump in the shear force VEd, which doesn't seem plausible to me.","The surfaces output in RFEM are smoothed internal forces. The design in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces is based solely on the internal forces smoothed within a surface. In this case, there is no smoothing across the stored line."
Is the lap length of the vertical stirrups checked in the case of a block foundation with smooth inner sleeves?,"The design of the block foundation and also the bucket foundation with smooth insides of the bucket is carried out by verifying the horizontal components Ho and Hu.Here the restraint moment at the column base is converted into a horizontal component on the top (Ho) and on the Underside (Hu) converted. In the case of block and pocket foundations with smooth inner sides, no vertical component is calculated that could be used to verify the anchoring. The situation is different with block and socket foundations with rough socket interiors. Here, the verification of the lap length of the bucket reinforcement can be activated in the details."
Is it possible to perform an earthquake analysis using the masonry material model?,"The module RF-/DYNAM Pro - Equivalent Loads includes only a linear analysis of structures. If you now use a nonlinear model for the calculation, RF-/DYNAM Pro - Equivalent Loads changes this internally and treats it as a linear model. The non-linearity in your model is the masonry, which cannot absorb tensile forces.The problem is the following: RF-/DYNAM Pro - Equivalent Loads calculates the equivalent loads linearly and exports the load cases from them. However, the load cases are then calculated non-linearly based on the material model, which is not entirely correct. In addition, the results are superimposed according to the SRSS or CQC method, which means that tensile and compressive forces are present in the model.In this case, you could, for example, change the masonry to isotropic linear and to linear Properties of the material model work. You could also introduce line hinges at this point, which could be used to bypass the moment restraint, for example."
Two cranes run on a crane runway. How are the stress groups to be defined when the cranes work together?,"In CRANEWAY, you enter the stress group provided by the manufacturer for each crane. In the fatigue analysis, KRANBAHN carries out the analysis for the individual damage as well as for the overall damage from both cranes. Here, according to EN 1993-6 Chapter 9.4.2, the rule recommended under NOTE is applied. With two cranes, the stress group of the crane with the lowest stress group is reduced by 2 for the overall damage. Example: Crane 1 S class: S6 Crane 2 S class: S5 Total damage S Class: S3 "
"A single-span beam, which consists of several apparently straight bars, has low torsional moments in the ""dead weight"" load case. Why?","It is very likely that there is an inaccuracy in the modeling, which should be checked as follows:Set the view in the direction of the member, then zoom in Selection of all existing nodes that should lie on a line: If the respective coordinates in the transverse direction to the member axis do not correspond, the corresponding field of the coordinate is empty and there is a deviation "
I would like to define a line support with failure in tension and instead absorb the tension force via a nodal support on this line. Why does the line support still receive a tensile force?,"When nodal supports are modeled on supported lines, this can lead to problems and incorrect definitions. Therefore, the following warning message also appears during the plausibility check. Become internal Line supports are treated like nodal supports at each FE node. If there is a nodal support on a line support, an FE node thus receives several support definitions. If the defined directions of the bearings are not the same, this is not critical and the warning message can be ignored. If the same directions are defined several times, contradictions arise.In the case of the line support failing in tension and the nodal support on this line, there is a tensile force in the FE node, which, however, belongs to the line and nodal support . To prevent this behavior, a short line be inserted without a support definition in the area of each nodal support. It also makes sense to model the tension support using a newly defined member. The power transmission can then be adjusted via the support of the rod, the rod type itself and the rod end joint. In general, the support stiffnesses should be estimated realistically; in the example, rigid supports were assumed for simplification. "
Can files from the StruSoft FEM-Design program be imported into RFEM? ,"Unfortunately, there is no interface to the StruSoft FEM-Design program. FEM-Design has interfaces to Autodesk Revit Structure and Tekla Structures, so that an import may be possible via these interfaces."
"I am designing a set of members using the equivalent member method in RF-/STEEL EC3, but the calculation is unsuccessful. The system is unstable with the message ""Undesignable - ER055) Zero value of the critical moment on the segment"".What could be the cause?","Please check whether all sets of members selected for the design are straight sets of members. The equivalent member method can only be used for straight sets of members with a uniform cross-section, i.e. no haunches, for example. In this case, the default General Procedure should be used."
How does the expenses for a service contract change if I buy another license of RFEM/RSTAB?,"With a Basic service contract, a net fee of 100.00 euros is charged for each subsequent license. With a Pro service contract, the fee for the subsequent license is EUR 150.00 net. In addition to RSTAB/RFEM, this also includes all integrated additional modules. In the case of network licenses deployed at more than one site, the service contract fees apply to each site. All prices can be found clearly underhttps://www.dlubal.com/de/ support-und-schulungen/service/servicevertrag If you have any further questions, you can contact our sales department at any time. "
"When switching from manual definition of the reinforcement areas to automatic arrangement of the reinforcement according to table 1.4, the result of the deformation calculation changes, although the basic reinforcement has not been changed. How does this change come about?","When arranging the reinforcement automatically, it must be ensured that, in addition to the basic reinforcement, further reinforcement for the verifications in the serviceability limit state is applied if necessary. The default setting in the module is selected so that the required reinforcement from the ultimate limit state for the SLS is also applied.Which reinforcement is applied for the SLS can be selected under ""Additional reinforcement for serviceability limit state analysis"". The individual options are explained in the Info button.The reinforcement applied for the design can be checked using the ""Reinforcement applied for SLS design"" function."
What is meant by the effect of masses in RF-/DYNAM Pro - Natural Vibrations?,"The directional effect of the masses must be specified. The masses can act in the global displacement directions X, Y or Z by ticking the corresponding checkboxes. Masses can also rotate around the global X, Y, and Z axes by selecting the appropriate checkboxes. These settings change the mass matrix and result in different eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies. In order to carry out a planar analysis of the structure, one only activates the masses in one of the global directions. A planar analysis is only allowed for regular buildings in plan and elevation. For a three-dimensional analysis, masses in all global directions are considered."
Is updating my add-ons covered by the service contract?,"The service contracts for the program family RFEM and RSTAB update the current main program as well as all additional modules available for it. We refer to this as an update of the respective main program (e.g. from RFEM 5.12 to 5.13). For all available and current additional modules, the provision of:new ones is free of charge Features and functions for the dimensioningposs. Error correctionsCalculation and dimensioning optimizationspossible standard adjustments or correctionsincluded as part of the service contract. The service contract does not include upgrades to new program versions (e.g. from RFEM 4.xx to RFEM 5.xx) and any new additional modules as a result of extensive revision."
"am designing an open, asymmetrical aluminum profile in RF-/ALUMINUM and get the warning ""Undesignable - 1022) General cross-section - stability analysis not available"". What is the reason and what can I do?","The reason is that there is no proof of stability for asymmetrical, open cross-sections according to EN 1999-1-1 when compressive axial forces and bending moments act.You can neglect the bending moments in the details in the Stability tab by defining a filter. Then the flexural buckling analysis is carried out without moments. However, this is done under your own responsibility. An alternative is to use a second-order stability analysis, which would be possible with the RF-/FE-LTB add-on module."

"I am using the load generator ""Convert area loads to member loads using cells"". What is the task of the ""Nodes on fictitious lines"" function?","If a cell that is closed on all sides is recognized in the static model, it can be used for the load application. However, if the desired load area is not completely enclosed by members, the cell will not be recognized by the load generator.The corner nodes of the load area can be specified manually with the ""Nodes on fictitious lines"" function, thereby clearly defining the cell area . The cell defined in this way can then be selected as usual using the pick function of the individual cell nodes."
How is the automatic formation of c/t parts carried out?,"Settings for the automatic formation of c/t parts can be made in the ""c/t parts and effective cross-section"" tab of the ""Calculation parameters"" dialog box. The angle can be specified from which a bearing is formed between two elements should be generated. If elements connect at a smaller angle, they are considered as a continuous c/t part. Reinforcements (longitudinal ribs, bevels (lips) or bulges, etc.) are not recognized by the program when the c/t parts are automatically generated. The c/t parts have to be adjusted manually here. The changes can be made in the table ""1.7 Cross-section parts for classification"" or in the dialog ""Edit c/t-part"". The element is ""major"" input field controls whether a curved element is classified as a c/t-part is taken into account. If the length of the arc is greater than the diameter to be specified here, it cannot be neglected. A corresponding error message appears before the calculation. The Element is ""straight"" option affects curved elements. Normally, bends are excluded from the determination of the effective widths, since the standards do not provide any clear specifications. A curved element is assumed to be straight if the ratio of the connecting line (start/end node) to the element length is greater than the specified value."
In RF-/DYNAM Pro there are two different modules for the response spectrum analysis. What reasons can there be if the results of the two modules differ?,"The differences between the two modules are explained in this FAQ explained.In general, with identical settings, the same results should be calculated for both modules. However, this does not apply to existing non-linearities. This is because no non-linearities are taken into account in the RF-/DYNAM Pro module. If the results are output via the Forced Vibrations add-on module, all non-linearities are ignored. In contrast, the equivalent loads are calculated on a linear system, but the exported load cases are then calculated in RFEM or RSTAB on the real system, i.e. with all non-linearities. This can lead to inconsistent results.If you turn off the nonlinearities for the exported load cases, you should get identical results.How to account for nonlinearities in the response spectrum analysis is explained using tension rods in this FAQ."
We recently got the following error message on a laptop. Can you tell me what we can do to fix the problem?,"The user-defined profile database EigProf.dat may be missing on your computer or it is damaged. Please open the ""Data directories"" tab of the program options and select the ""Custom cross-section library"" category here. Open the one that is displayed directory and please check whether the EigProf.dat file is present. If the file exists, please rename it.

Can I easily overwrite the old tlbs and dlls of the COM interface?,"In principle, any changes to the COM interface are named in our update report for the respective module. All update reports can be viewed under the following Link . If there is a change in the COM interface, it will be listed there. In particular when converting the older COM interface from RSTAB6/RFEM3 to RSTAB8/RFEM5, complete compatibility is not guaranteed due to the change from tlbs in VBA to a consistent solution with dlls. Within the current COM interface, overwriting the dlls is usually possible without problems. For additional security, it is of course always advisable to back up the old files. "
What is the difference between upgrade and update?,"UpdateUpdates are regular updates of programs and add-on modules as part of product maintenance. These are, for example:Extensions or improvements in the functionality of programs and add-on modulesFixation of detected or reported bugs Updates are always chargeable. The costs for updates are covered by active service contracts of a product group and are reflected in the Dlubal account automatically made available. Without an active service contract, updates must be purchased separately as required. UpgradeUpgrade is a comprehensive one Further or new development of programs or additional modules. Significant program parts or functionalities have been renewed or added with a high level of development effort. If you already have an additional module that has been reissued, eg for RF-/FUND appears new RF-/FUND Pro, then there is the possibility of an upgrade. An upgrade is chargeable, but cheaper than buying a new one. If you have any questions, please contact sales."
Is it possible to call up the list of print logs via the COM interface?,"No, this is not possible. The protocol cannot be accessed or managed via the COM interface. The only thing that is possible is to call up the number of logs created from a list. It is possible to access the sample logs. This is explained in the following FAQ . However, this cannot be controlled via the COM interface of RFEM/RSTAB, but a general Windows functionality."
"For the settlement calculation with the RF-SOILIN add-on module, the specific gravity gamma and the specific gravity gamma,sat are queried for a soil. What do I need the value gamma,sat for and how is it included in the calculation?","The value $\gamma,_{sat}$ corresponds to the specific gravity of the saturated soil and can be adjusted if necessary in the material parameter settings. If there is groundwater in a layer, the specific gravity of the saturated soil $\gamma,_{sat}$ is automatically reduced by the specific gravity of the groundwater (10kN/m³) from this layer onwards. Above this layer, the stresses are calculated with the specific gravity of the soil."
Can I also lease a program?,"Dlubal Software GmbH offers no leasing options as a lessor. If you would like to lease the programs, please contact a company operating freely on the market, such as in Germany the companies GRENKE or MMV Leasing.

Can the cases of the individual modules be calculated individually or is the CalculateAll() method always used for the calculation?,Each module has its own method for calculating a case in a module. Here are the methods of the individual modules for the case calculation: RF/Wood - IModuleCase -> Calculate()RF-/STEEL EC3 - ICase -> moCalculate()RF-/ALUMINIUM - ICase -> moCalculate()RF-/STEEL - IstCase -> stResultsCalculate()RF STABLE - IsbCase -> sbResultsCalculate()RF-/DYNAM Pro - IDynamModule -> Calculate()RF-/CONCRETE Members - IcoCase -> coResultsCalculate()RF/CONCRETE surfaces - IcoCase -> coResultsCalculate() 
Why is it necessary to specify the concrete cover in DICKQ? The position of the individual reinforcement bars is already specified directly in the cross-section definition.,"In DICKQ you can select the ""Design"" option for the reinforced concrete design. In In this case, a range of possible reinforcement diameters can be defined when entering the reinforcement bars. The program can then design a diameter in this defined area, with which the bending design is fulfilled. By specifying the concrete cover, it is checked whether the designed reinforcing steel diameter is inserted can. If the concrete cover is entered or is too large If the required diameter is too large, you will receive a corresponding error message after starting the calculation. "
Is it possible to switch from RSTAB to RFEM?,"Yes, that is possible in principle. But there are a few things to consider. It might make sense to keep RSTAB available as a license in order to be able to edit old projects easily in the future.RFEM can open RSTAB models. The structure and load data are taken over with the exception of a few exceptional situations. With additional modules, however, due to different data formats (RFEM has surface and solid elements in addition to RSTAB), rework or a new entry may be necessary.Any current service contracts must also be converted.There as they are different product families, there is no standard price for an upgrade. We are happy to provide price information after assessing the respective case. Simply contact our sales department."
How do network licenses work and how often can a program be licensed on them?,"In general, 2 things are required for licensing:License keyRelated authorization fileThe license key can be made available on a central company server via a USB dongle or via a network softlock. For licensing from a client, there must be a permanent connection to the server. As soon as a license is occupied, this is on the server's web-based license interface via http://localhost:1947/_int_/sessions.html viewable. An automatic timeout after 12 hours of inactivity prevents a license from remaining permanently in use and releases it to other users.With the latest generation of license keys, 50 licenses can be activated for each program and add-on module. That means, for example, a maximum of 50 computers can access RFEM and RF-STEEL EC3 at the same time."
"Is the Dlubal online service ""Cross-Section Values"" free of charge?","Yes, the online service for retrieving cross-section values for profiles and cross-sections is free of charge."
What does superposition mean according to CQC rule in dynamic analysis?,"The complete quadratic combination (CQC rule) must be applied when studying spatial models with mixed torsional/translational eigenmodes, there are neighboring modal shapes whose periods differ by less than 10%. If this is not the case, the root sum of squares rule (SRSS rule) should be used. In all other cases, the CQC rule must be applied. The CQC rule is defined as follows: with the correlation factor: The correlation coefficient is simplified if the viscous damping value D is chosen to be the same for all mode shapes: In analogy to the SRSS rule, the CQC rule can also be used can be executed as an equivalent linear combination. The formula of the modified CQC rule is as follows: "
What does the superposition according to the SRSS rule mean in dynamic analysis?,"The settings determine how results from different mode shapes of the structure are combined. The modal combination is the first step of the dynamic combinations. The modal answers can be combined with the Square-sum root rule (SRSS) or the Complete square combination rule (CQC). Both of these quadratic combinations can be applied in the standard form or modified as an equivalent linear combination. The standard form of the SRSS rule combines maximal results and the signs are lost, the combining rule is as follows: ${\text E}_{\text{SRSS }}\;=\;\sqrt{\mathrm E2\;1\;+\;\mathrm E2\;2\;+\;\dots\;+\;\mathrm E\;2}$ In the RFEM add-on module RF-DYNAM Pro, a modified form of the SRSS rule is available to determine associated results such as associated internal forces . Associated internal forces are usually significantly smaller compared to the standard form of the SRSS rule. In addition, the associated signs are correct in relation to the decisive internal force. The SRSS rule is applied as an equivalent linear combination: ${\mathrm E}_{\mathrm{SRSS}}\;=\overset{\mathrm p }{\underset{\mathrm i=1}{\sum{\mathrm f}_{\mathrm i}}}{\mathrm E}_{\mathrm i}$ with: $f_i=\frac{E_i}{\sqrt{{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^p} E_j^2}}$ When this formula is applied, the results are internally consistent."

How does the orthotropic plastic material model work in RFEM?,"The Tsai-Wu material model combines plastic and orthotropic properties. This enables special modeling of materials with anisotropic characteristics such as plastic or wood. When plasticizing the material, the stresses remain constant. A rearrangement takes place depending on the stiffnesses that exist in the individual directions. The elastic area corresponds to the ""Orthotrop - 3D"" material model. The following yield condition according to Tsai-Wu applies to the plastic area:${\text{f}}_{\mathrm{crit}}\left(\mathrm\sigma\right)=\frac1{\ mathrm C}\left[\frac{\left({\mathrm\sigma}_{\mathrm x}-{\mathrm\sigma}_{\mathrm x,0}\right)^2}{{\mathrm f }_{\mathrm t,\mathrm x}{\mathrm f}_{\mathrm c,\mathrm x}}+\frac{\left({\mathrm \sigma }_{\mathrm y}-{\mathrm \sigma}_{\mathrm y,0}\right)^2}{{\mathrm f}_{\mathrm t,\mathrm y}{\mathrm f}_{\mathrm c,\mathrm y}}+ \frac{\left({\mathrm\sigma}_{\mathrm z}-{\mathrm\sigma }_{\mathrm z,0}\right)^2}{{\mathrm f}_{\mathrm t ,\mathrm z}{\mathrm f}_{\mathrm c,\mathrm z}}+\frac{{\mathrm \tau}_{\mathrm {yz}}}^2}{{\mathrm f}_{ \mathrm v,\mathrm{yz}}^2}+\frac{{\mathrm\tau}_{\mathrm{xz}}}^2}{{\mathrm f}_{\mathrm v,\mathrm{xz} }}^2}+\frac{{\mathrm{tau}_{\mathrm{xy}}^2}{{\mathrm f}_{\mathrm v,\mathrm{xy}}^2}\right] $with:${\mathrm\sigma}_{\mathrm x,0}=\frac{{\mathrm f}_{\mathrm t,\mathrm x }-{\mathrm f}_{\mathrm c,\mathrm x}}2$${\mathrm \sigma }_{\mathrm y,0}=\frac{{\mathrm f }_{\mathrm t,\mathrm y}-{\mathrm f}_{\mathrm c,\mathrm y}}2$${\mathrm \sigma }_{\mathrm z, 0}=\frac{{\mathrm f}_{\mathrm t,\mathrm z}-{\mathrm f}_{\mathrm c,\mathrm z}}2$$\mathrm C=1+\left[\frac1{{\mathrm f}_{\mathrm t,\mathrm x}}+\frac1{{\mathrm f}_{\mathrm c,\mathrm x}}\right]^ 2\frac{{\mathrm E}_{\mathrm x}{\mathrm E}_{\mathrm p,\mathrm x}}{{\mathrm E}_{\mathrm x}-{\mathrm E}_ {\mathrm p,\mathrm x}}\mathrm \alpha +\frac{{\mathrm \sigma }_{\mathrm x,0}^2}{{\mathrm f}_{\mathrm t,\mathrm x} {\mathrm f}_{\mathrm c,\mathrm x}}+\frac{{\mathrm \sigma }_{\mathrm y,0}^2}{{\mathrm f}_{\mathrm t,\ mathrm y}{\mathrm f}_{\mathrm c,\mathrm y}}+\frac{{\mathrm \sigma }_{\mathrm z,0}^2}{{\mathrm f}_{\mathrm t,\mathrm z}{\mathrm f}_{\mathrm c,\mathrm y}}$The yield condition can be imagined as an elliptical surface in the six-dimensional stress space. If one of the three stress components is assumed to be a constant value, the area can be projected onto a three-dimensional stress space.If the value for fy(σ) is less than 1, then the Stresses in the elastic area. The plastic range is reached as soon as fy(σ) = 1. Values greater than 1 are not permitted. The model behaves ideally plastic, ie there is no stiffening."

Can I edit a printout report without opening it?,"Some properties of saved printout reports can be edited without the sometimes time-consuming opening of the report being necessary.To do this, select the printout report in the project navigator and right-click to open the context menu. The contents of the printout report can be adjusted using the ""Selection"" option. "
"Why does the ""Snow load zones, wind zones and earthquake zones"" online service sometimes display a different load value than the associated standard?","The online service ""Snow load zones, wind zones and earthquake zones"" can only store a constant value over a surface area. Indicates the respective load standard instead of a usual one Zoning displays an isoline representation of the load across land, the interactive load map displays the areas between the isolines as zones of constant value. The larger value of the two enclosing isolines is assigned to these zones. Accordingly, this ""stepped"" load representation for locations between the isolines leads to a conservative load determination. "

In RF-CONCRETE Surfaces I get a high amount of reinforcement in connection with a lever arm that is close to zero. How does such a small lever arm of the internal forces come about?,"The situation can be caused by the following conditions: Reinforcement layers are almost next to each other in the centroid of the areaIt was a small bar diameter is selectedThe cross-section is completely drawn, i.e. there is no compression zone height. In this case, the smallest distance between the reinforcement layers is used as the lever arm. If this is close to zero, the lever arm is also set close to zero."

Please contact our sales department with this request. He will advise you to the best of his knowledge and work out an offer that suits the desired goal."
Which material model is associated with a contact solid made of wood?,"For wood, the ""Orthotropic Elastic/Plastic 3D"" material model must always be assigned to the ""Material"" solid type. Since the solid type ""Contact"" is regarded as a bar internally in the program, it generally requires an isotropic material model. "
Which result combinations can I measure with the RF-/JOINTS program and what should I pay attention to?,"The RF-/JOINTS module is divided into several connection groups. See also the following FAQ.Let it be the special features of the dimensioning are not as in this FAQ answer in general. In contrast to the RF-/TIMBER Pro module, in the FAQ mentioned, it is noticeable with the RF-/JOINTS modules that the EK2 also cannot be dimensioned by manually switching the KLED, for example in the RF-/JOINTS TIMBER STEEL module to TIMBER. This also applies to the RF-GLASS and RF-/CONCRETE NL modules. The reason here is that some joint groups of the RF-/JOINTS module export stiffnesses to the program become. Overlaying with result combinations is not permitted for non-linear calculations. For the second result combination mentioned, there is then the peculiarity that even with simple systems the superposition is no longer conservative. Even if the KLED is changed manually, the dimensioning cannot be carried out correctly here. If a result combination is to be superimposed with constantly and alternatively additively, the EK2 would have to be in the attached File can be split into load combinations as follows. LK1=LF2LK2=LF1+LF2EK2*=LK1 or LK2 "

Are Dlubal licenses lifetime licenses?,"Purchased licenses are lifetime licenses. In principle, they can be used without a time limit. With the conclusion of a service contract, you will receive the updates provided for your version. In this way, you always work with the latest development status. As an alternative to purchasing, rental licenses or a subscription are available. If you have any questions, please contact sales. "
"In an add-on module, I have inputs for certain objects, such as e.g. B. members or surfaces and after the calculation or dimensioning in this additional module I renumbered the objects in the main program. Are the changes automatically reflected in the add-on?",The changes are not taken into account in the additional module and must be adjusted manually.
What is the difference between network and single user licenses?,"With a single-user license, the user works with the programs licensed for his workstation. The use of the licenses is controlled via a key (USB hardlock, also known as a dongle or softlock). The key is located directly on the computer at the respective workplace. Instead of the USB hardlock, software (softlock) can also take over the protective function. The associated authorization file (author.ini) controls which programs can be operated specifically with the respective key. The advantage of such a single-user license is that the user in the form of the key exactly its configuration of the programs always available. No one else can use or block the programs at the same time. With a USB hardlock, for example, the use of the programs can easily be transferred from one computer to the other by replugging. The prerequisite is that the programs have been installed once on the computer with the associated authorization. The same also works with the softlock. Only the relocation procedure is a bit more complex here and can be carried out using software. Single-user licenses are particularly advantageous for smaller offices with few users who always work with the same software configuration. With a network license the license is protected via a special network key. This is also available as a USB hardlock or softlock. The network key can be attached to or installed on any computer that can be reached in the network. A special license manager then controls access to this. The Dlubal software itself is installed locally, as with the single-user license. The authorization file then specifies that the protection key is searched for in the network. The advantage of the network license is that the key can be switched/moved from the workplace to the workplace is omitted. Once the software has been installed, it can also be used as long as a license is available and is not already being used by another user. Another major advantage is that the respective set of program modules can be better adapted to the needs. Additional modules that are used less frequently can be purchased in fewer numbers than employees need to be able to work with them. The probability is low that another employee is also using the license at the same time. Additional modules can therefore be shared among each other. Due to the possibility of using softlocks, it can also be used on virtual machines. If network licenses are used, access to the Dlubal programs is also possible via remote access to computers, such as via Remote Desktop. Since not everyone usually has physical access to the server, the license is better protected against theft, for example, and you don't have to look for it with other employees. Network licenses are now the standard for larger companies with several employees. Example Single-user license Employee A works in the reinforced concrete area: RFEM, RF-CONCRETE, EC2 for RFEM, RF-PUNCH Pro, RF-CONCRETE Columns Employee B works in the steel construction area: RFEM, RF-STEEL EC3, RF-STABILITY, RF-DYNAM natural vibrations If employee A also needs access to RF-DYNAM Basis, he must obtain the key from employee B. However, he cannot then work on a reinforced concrete structure. Comparison of network license with the same equipment Two licenses RFEM, RF-CONCRETE, EC2 for RFEM, RF-PUNCH Pro, RF-CONCRETE Columns, RF-STEEL EC3, RF-STABIL, RF-DYNAM Natural vibrations Each employee can access the full range of additional modules as long as the other employee is not working with them at the same time. The license is only used when the plug-in is open (in use). For example, a supporting structure with mixed materials made of steel and concrete could also be processed. Due to the increased usability and flexibility regarding the additional modules, network licenses are subject to a surcharge of approx. 25% of the first license price (all prices can be seen in the web shop)."
Is it possible to specify a uniaxial stress direction for the 'generated load'?,"In the load generators, you can use the 'Without effect on' function to exclude individual members from area load generation and thus specify a direction of tension."
Are future upgrades of RFEM/RSTAB and the individual programs included in the service contract?,"Our service contracts include the updates (e.g. RFEM 5.01, 5.02...) of the current program version. These include new features, error corrections, optimizations and adjustments to normative changes in the entire program family. Upgrades to higher program versions are generally not covered by the service contract, but appear due to long runtimes and intensive further development of the current program version at relatively large time intervals. Upgrades must be purchased in the event of a release, but are offered with a discount for an existing service contract . This fact has advantages for you as a customer. This means lower ongoing service contract costs and the ability to choose when to invest in upgrades. "
Why does the membrane constrict so much when finding the form? I get very large deformation values.,"The reason for such an effect could be free edges, which can deform almost infinitely during the form finding process. A state of equilibrium can only be achieved with difficulty. As a basis for finding the shape, there should be no free edges on the membrane surface. Ropes are to be arranged at the free edges of the membrane, the rigidity of which can be based, for example, on the folded or reinforced membrane edge strips."
Is the purchase price for subsequent licenses reduced at Dlubal?,"Subsequent licenses are reduced in price.Both the main programs RFEM and RSTAB, as well as all additional modules, are reduced in price by 30 percent for a subsequent license, i.e. from the second license onwards, compared to the first license. When is a license a subsequent licenseA first license and the subsequent license must each belong to the same product group. Only a purchased existing first license from RFEM, for example, leads to a price reduction as a follow-up license for the purchase of further RFEM licenses. The same applies to the product group RSTAB, as well as to the individual applications. The additional modules are also only to be considered in the respective product group of RFEM or RSTAB. Licenses from rent or Subscription (subscription) are not considered for the classification as follow-up license. Note on service contractsService contracts must be concluded separately for the respective product group RFEM or RSTAB . Follow-up licenses are automatically included in the service contract for the respective product group and invoiced at a reduced price. If you require advice, please contact sales. "
Is there a free viewer to open files from RFEM or RSTAB?,"Yes, a free viewer for model files from RFEM and RSTAB is available. The viewer is installed automatically when installing RFEM or RSTABThe program icons are stored on your desktop If you do not have a license from RFEM or RSTAB, you can obtain the viewer with the respective trial version. (Download link see below)Model data with results can be opened and viewed in the viewerThe data cannot be edited "
Is it possible to display contour lines in the area results?,In the options for the color spectrum in the panel it is possible to define contour lines with a self-defined interval.
What advantages do network or floating licenses offer over local licenses?,"The use of network or floating licenses in your company has the following advantages:Generally lower license costs, since fewer licenses are required for additional moduleslarge ones Flexibility of the licenses due to the concurrent user license modelEasy to use at different company locations and in the home office (requires a VPN connection)Working via RDP connection on one other computers is permittedbetter and easier administration possibleall products purchased are generally available on all clientssearching for the appropriate local dongle (assuming different license allocation) does not applyPreventing the loss and damage of a dongle, since it is protected on the serverNote: According to the service contract conditions, the use of the program is above Network licenses require a separate service contract for each company location."
Which result combinations can I design with the RF-/TIMBER Pro program and what should I pay attention to?,"In general, all result combinations can be designed with the program RF-/TIMBER Pro. With timber construction, however, there is the special feature that the decisive load combination due to the class of the load duration (KLED) is not the combination with the largest internal forces. For the result combinations, a distinction must be made between 4 basic types of combinations. All actions are permanent and additive (+/-) superimposed.Actions are different in permanent or variable but additive (+/-) superimposed.All actions are constant, but superimposed with ""or"".All actions are variable, but superimposed with ""or"".A special feature In this context, there is still the combination of the RF-/DYNAM Pro module. Here the results are constantly superimposed and additionally squared. However, these combinations are then comparable with the 3rd combination mentioned above. Results used in WOOD Pro per result combination. Use maximum moment in attached file. The KLED ""Short"" is correctly considered.In the simple example, the moment is correctly considered. However, a support moment on the continuous beam can be incorrectly taken into account. The KLED in the EK2 is taken into account as ""constantly"" by default. This makes the design too uneconomical and would have to be changed in this case. However, the continuous beam mentioned could always be correct.The EK3 and EK4 are purely a result evaluation that is possible in every design module. "
Is a combination of purchase and rental possible?,"The combination of purchase and rent is possible. An active service contract ensures that rented programs and add-on modules are compatible with purchased programs. If you do not have a service contract yet, please contact sales for a consultation. Examples You are using one or more purchased RFEM or RSTAB licenses with different add-on modules and require additional RFEM or RSTAB licenses for a project. Rent the additionally required number of licenses and add-on modules for a period of 1, 3 or 6 months to use them for work on the project. You are using one or more RFEM or RSTAB licenses without additional modules. The various additional modules should only be used if necessary for projects with a limited duration. Rent the additional modules according to your needs for a period of 1, 3 or 6 months. As an alternative to renting, licenses and additional modules can be purchased as a subscription a term of 12 months each. A subscription is automatically renewed for a further 12 months if it is not terminated in due time. Please contact sales for advice."
Can (intermediate) dimensions be added to or deleted from a dimension chain that has already been created?,"No dimensions can be added or deleted in an existing dimension chain. The dimension chain in question must be deleted and recreated. Only the settings such as offset etc., can be edited."
Can custom viewpoints be saved without changing the view navigator visibility and settings?,"Custom viewpoints cannot be saved without changing visibility and View Navigator settings. However, the position set can be set as an isometric view using the ""Set as default"" button."
I would like to receive an individual demonstration of the program. What do I have to consider?,An individual demonstration is usually possible with a lead time of one to a maximum of two weeks. Please send us three suggested dates. The employee concerned will then contact you.The demonstration itself runs via the TeamViewer or GoToMeeting program. You will receive a link to download the relevant program in advance. You should plan about an hour for the demonstration.
Can I use the RF STEEL Surfaces add-on module to carry out a hot design for steel surfaces?,"The RF STEEL Surfaces add-on module performs an elastic stress analysis for surfaces. A hot design is not implemented, but can be performed by manually adjusting the stiffness in RFEM and adjusting the yield point in the module."
"In mask 3.1 in the RF-CONCRETE Members module, you have the option of saving reinforcement templates and storing the template library in a *.res file on the hard drive.Is there a way to store these files in an external one software to process?",The *.res files do not have a standardized format and it is unfortunately not possible to process these files externally. This option is primarily used for interchangeability between PCs and backups.
"Why is a transverse pressure coefficient kc,90 of 1.0 assumed in the bearing pressure analysis?","In the case of concentrated loads near the support, it is prescribed according to Section 6.1.5(4) of Eurocode 5 to use the lower transverse pressure coefficient of kc,90 . Optionally, there is the option of switching off the support pressure verification in the RX-TIMBER program and providing appropriate lateral pressure reinforcements. If the entered concentrated load is not relevant to the design, the user also has the option to assign the transverse pressure coefficient user-defined. "
Why do I get different results for the same end plate joint in RF-/JOINTS Steel - DSTV and RF-/JOINTS Steel - Rigid?,"In addition to input errors in the geometry, the different calculation bases of the two modules are usually the cause.The design of an end plate joint with the add-on module RF-/JOINTS Steel - DSTV is carried out by comparing the stored ultimate limit capacities with the design internal forces. The underlying carrying capacities are taken from the current DSTV ring binder. When using the RF-/JOINTS Steel - Rigid add-on module, the load-bearing capacities of the connections according to DIN EN 1993-1-8 are calculated using the component method. The results can thus be influenced directly via the settings made. By default, an elastic distribution of the screw forces is taken as a basis. Additional load-bearing reserves can be activated by selecting a plastic force distribution in the connection. These are already included in the limit capacities according to the DSTV ring binder. In order to obtain comparable results between the two modules, a plastic force distribution must therefore be used for the calculation. It is also important to ensure correct modeling of the connection geometry. "
Can the program create a table for me that shows the maximum pairs of internal forces of several members? For example for the upper chord of a truss and the struts.,"Yes, this is possible. For this purpose, the members are to be combined in a set of members. The ""Continuous member"" type can be used for continuously connected members. For other members use ""Group of members"". The distinction is basically only important for later design in additional modules. After creating the sets of members and calculating the structure, the internal forces can be output in the ""Sets of members - internal forces"" results table. Unwanted results can be hidden using the table filter. "
Are there network or floating licenses and how is the surcharge calculated?,"We also offer network licenses for all products. It is a concurrent user license model with central management of the licenses on your own server. We use the Sentinel product portfolio from Gemalto GmbH and the license management software for the server is available for Windows and Linux systems. The surcharge per license, regardless of whether it is the first or subsequent license, is 25% of the Initial License Price. For the additional modules, the minimum surcharge of EUR 250 may apply. The authorization on the server can done via: USB hardlock (Sentinel HL NetTime) Softlock (Sentinel SL)Note: According to the terms of the service contract, using the program via network licenses requires a separate service contract for each company location. "
"get the error message 2379 ""Invalid material data!"" in the RF-CONCRETE Members module, what can I do?","In mask 1.2 in the module you can see which parameters are not permitted because they are highlighted in red. However, only the materials that are used by the members/sets of members to be designed are important.Sets of members that contain members with impermissible materials represent another problem. This also includes rigid members and similar member types that do not use any permitted material."
"According to which formula is the ideal critical load for torsional buckling Ncr,T calculated in RF-/STEEL EC3?","The ideal critical load for torsional buckling Ncr,T is calculated as follows:${\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{cr },\mathrm{T}\;=\frac1{{\mathrm{i}_{\mathrm{M}^2}\;\cdot\;\left(\frac{\mathrm{\pi}^2\;\cdot\; \mathrm E\;\cdot\;{\mathrm I}_{\mathrm w}}{{\mathrm L}_{\mathrm T}^2}\;+\;\mathrm G\;\cdot\; {\mathrm I}_{\mathrm t}\right)$${\mathrm i}_{\mathrm M}\;=\;\sqrt{{\mathrm i}_{\ mathrm u}^2\;+\;{\mathrm i}_{\mathrm v}^2\;+\;{\mathrm u}_{\mathrm M}^2\;+\;{\mathrm v }_{\mathrm M}^2}$It containsE Young's modulus G Shear modulus Iw Warping resistance It torsional moment of inertia iu, iv Main radii of inertia um, vm Coordinates of the shear center in the main axis system LT torsional buckling length "
"would like to do the calculation overnight. Unfortunately, however, the program requires input for the messages. Can this be turned off?","The display of the warning messages before the calculation can be switched off via the check box ""Show warning messages before the calculation"" in the program options."
How does the service contract increase when purchasing additional add-on modules?,"In principle, the annual costs for the service contract for the respective program family, whether ""Basic"" or ""Pro"", are only calculated based on the number of existing licenses for the main program RFEM or RSTAB. The costs for the service contract are therefore clearly defined and constant, since they are not linked to the overall package as a percentage. Advantage The costs for the service contract do not increase when the range of applications of RFEM or RSTAB is expanded with additional modules. This gives you cost security and only one additional workstation, i.e. another RFEM or RSTAB license, means an increase in the annual costs. "
Which interfaces are already included in RFEM/RSTAB and are there others that can be purchased?,TTTT
Are all add-on modules for RSTAB also available in RFEM?,"RSTAB and RFEM are two separate product groups, whereby the scope of services of RSTAB is also fully integrated in RFEM. All add-on modules for RSTAB are also available for RFEM. Some program parts have been extended in the RFEM product group for surface and solid elements.The only exception is the SUPER-EK module. This add-on module is only available with RSTAB."
Can the geo-zone tool for load determination also be integrated into a web service (API)? What are the conditions?,"In addition to manual operation, the website also offers a web service (API) for connecting to external programs. The following packages are available for this purpose. The same conditions apply as for manual operation. Geo Zone Tool | 500 queriesGeo Zone Tool | 5000 queries "
inserted a block into a file. Changes have now been made to this block in the block manager. Can the already inserted block now be automatically updated?,"When inserting a block, the assignment to the block defined in the block manager is lost, so that it is not possible to update the block that has already been inserted after changing the block in the block manager. However, in the detail settings of the ""Insert Block"" dialog, there is the possibility to create a named visibility for this block. This makes it possible to quickly find this block again later via the project navigator Views and to replace it with the updated block."
"I can't see any members when I have selected the RF-/STEEL EC3 module as ""Load case"", why?","This is because no results were selected. As soon as at least one checkbox is activated, which leads to results, then the members are also displayed."
"Bottom and top chords must be spliced over a support, but the verticals and diagonals are connected to the chords.How should the joints be arranged?","If the chords are not continuous and the diagonal braces are attached to the chords, then an intermediate bar may need to be inserted. A system where the chord is not continuous, but the Diagonals are rigidly connected to the belt. In order to be able to transfer the moments of the diagonals to the chord, the diagonal must arrive in the chord before the impact, otherwise the moment of the diagonal will be transferred to the opposite bar.If the diagonals can also be connected in an articulated manner, the intermediate rod can be dispensed with. The only thing to note here is that at least one bar is not connected in an articulated manner, so that the connection node cannot be freely rotated. If a vertical is used, this must either be connected to one of the two belts or between both straps. In both cases, the model is suitable and must be modified accordingly. The model with a vertical between the straps and the variant with the vertical on the right strap."
What geo load zone tool packages are available?,"The Dlubal Online Service Geo Zone Tool for load determination contains zone maps for quickly determining snow load zones, wind load zones and earthquake zones. The following packages are available. Geo zone tool | 500 queriesGeo Zone Tool | 5000 queriesGeo Zone Tool | 15000 queries All employees of a company can use this quota for all supported maps or load standards without any time restrictions. The geo-zone tool for load determination is continuously being expanded and added."
"In FE-BUCKLING, the reduction factor is calculated to take into account behavior similar to buckling bars χc with the modified slenderness ratio of the sheet metal field ${\overline{\mathrm\lambda}}_{\mathrm p}$. Why is this not calculated with the slenderness ratio of the equivalent compression member ${\overline{\mathrm\lambda}}_{\mathrm c}$?","FE-BUCKLING performs the buckling safety verification according to Chapter 10 ""Method of reduced stresses"" of EN 1993-1-5. According to EN 1993-1-5, 10 (5) a), all reduction coefficients are to be determined with the modified slenderness of the sheet metal panel ${\overline{\mathrm\lambda}}_{\mathrm p}$ according to equation (10.2). ."
"When calculating mode shapes with RF-/DYNAM Pro, I get effective modal mass factors, which are all close to 0. What could be the cause for this?","The cause of small effective modal mass factors can be very diverse. This can often be observed with larger structures. In most cases, the cause of this problem is that only local eigenmodes occur. How you can deal with this is explained below: The evaluation of whether it really is a matter of local eigenmodes should be carried out using the result graphic. If individual members or surfaces have a very low natural frequency, these appear first. If these local eigenmodes are to be included in the calculation, the number of eigenmodes to be calculated should be increased.If local eigenmodes occur on surfaces, the masses of the affected surfaces can be neglected. This function is explained in this post. In the case of local eigenmodes on members, it makes sense to deactivate the FE mesh division on members. If all of these notes have been observed, you should only global eigenmodes of the structure occur, which also activate a high mass. "
"During the calculation in RF-CONCRETE Members, I get the warning ""Error when importing the internal forces"" from the main program!"" although there are results. What is the cause?","Result members can be designed in RF-CONCRETE Members. If the result members to be designed are incorrectly defined so that no internal forces can be determined for them, this warning message appears during the design in RF-CONCRETE Members. The incorrectly defined result members can be found via the output of the member section sizes. These result members are then to be changed accordingly.In the present example, no internal forces are output for result member 2. For this result bar, instead of area 2, area 1 was incorrectly specified as the included object."
What procurement options are there for Dlubal software?,"Dlubal programs can only be purchased through the direct sales of Dlubal Software GmbH, branches in various countries or authorized resellers.

"Although I have chosen a column web rib for my connection, this is apparently not taken into account in the design. How are the web ribs treated in the design?","Specifically for the ""Column web, compressive force below"" check, a specified web rib is only used in the check if it is actually required, or if the check cannot be performed without a web rib. In the case of the latter, the comment ""Bar rib required"" is output in the last column of the results table. It is also important to note whether a continuous or a partial rib is used.The partial rib is the compressive force is divided between the web and the rib and thus measured. If a continuous rib is used, the column web is fully utilized first and the excess load is applied to the rib. This procedure prevents the rib from being overloaded, especially with T-joints and cross-joints. "
Why does an automatic combination result in several apparently identical load combinations?,"The automatically created load combinations result exclusively from the definition of the combination rules. It can happen that two load combinations are formed according to different combination rules, but contain the same load cases with the same factors. Nevertheless, the load combinations only appear to be the same, because the information stored about the load combination is different. The load combinations contain an assignment to the underlying combination rule and can then be selected collectively during the design, for example.Since it is therefore necessary to store a unique combination rule for each load combination, these will appear to be the same Load combinations not merged. "
"For my evaluation of the results, I only need the extreme values of the vertical support forces with the associated horizontal forces from a result combination for several support nodes. Can this be set in the program? ","The extreme values of all support reactions are always displayed in the graphical output. In other words, the largest and smallest values across all possible combinations. However, the individual bearing forces cannot be combined in this way, since they usually arise in different load situations. However, the extreme values with the associated results are output in the tabular result output. In addition, the associated load combination or the associated load cases are specified there by default in column H. If you only need the extreme values of PZ with the associated horizontal forces, you can use the filter function of the results table according to the graphic use."
My Windows Explorer has been very slow for a while. Could this possibly also be related to RFEM?,"Yes, the problem could possibly also be caused by RFEM. The preview of RFEM files in the Windows Explorer can cause the Explorer to react more slowly. One possible solution is as follows: In C:\Program Files\Common Files\Dlubal the file ThmShellEx64.dll in BACKUP-ThmShellEx64. dll . Or for 32-bit in C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Dlubal the file Rename ThmShellEx.dll to BACKUP-ThmShellEx.dll Then the PC needs to be restarted"
Where can I find the RF-CONCRETE Deflect add-on module? How can I activate it?,"The add-on module RF-CONCRETE Deflect is a module extension of RF-CONCRETE Surfaces. The calculation of the deformations in state II with RF-CONCRETE Deflect can be activated by entering in RF-CONCRETE surfaces in the ""Serviceability"" tab sets the ""analytical verification method"". The ""Deformations with RF-CONCRETE Deflect"" option can be activated in the detail settings. The results from the calculation with RF-CONCRETE Deflect are then available in the ""Serviceability"" tab in the results navigator for the respective design case. "
"Can I see the intermediate steps for determining the wind load, such as the degree of completeness, in RF-/TOWER Loads?","In the result tables of the module you can see all intermediate values depending on the wind direction and side as well as section. This function is also available in the long version of the log, but it can significantly increase the scope of the log."
"When entering a building, at one point I have a wall on top of a slab that is unsupported underneath. What modeling options are there for this?","If the load-bearing property of the shear wall is neglected and only applied as a line load to the ceiling, the deformations are too large RFEM. Line release, in which only vertical compressive forces are transferred. The nonlinear property is only applied to the force transfer directly at the connecting line of both surfaces. Non-linear material ""Isotropic masonry"". Here, the tensile stresses in the x and y directions (i.e. vertical and horizontal) are iteratively reduced to the set limit values by reducing the stiffness. With this model, the behavior of a masonry wall can be represented most realistically, since the reduction in tensile stress occurs in the direction of the mortar joints. The ""RF-MAT-NL"" add-on module is required for this.Non-linear surface stiffness type ""Diaphragm free"". Here, the tensile stresses in the main stress direction are iteratively reduced by reducing the stiffness."
Where in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces can I specify a basic reinforcement with specification of diameter and bar spacing?,"The existing basic reinforcement for reinforced concrete surfaces by specifying a bar spacing and bar diameter can be found in the input dialog 1.4 of RF-CONCRETE Surfaces in the ""Longitudinal Reinforcement"" tab. . If a diameter and a distance are entered, the program automatically determines the reinforcement content [cm²/m]. Clicking the ""OK"" button accepts this value."
Can I apply an impact load to just the quiver rather than the entire foundation?,"The impact load is first defined as a load case in RFEM or RSTAB. This load case is then taken into account in a load or result combination for which the support forces are determined. RF-/FOUNDATION Pro always uses the support forces from RFEM or RSTAB in the design. This happens for all verifications and cannot be controlled separately. There is only the option of completely deactivating a specific support force for the verifications. If you do not want to consider a load for the geotechnical verifications because the foundation e.g . B. is otherwise structurally secured in relation to the impact load, you can deactivate the load in the setting shown. However, if the impact load is then used in the bending design (e.g. B. the quiver walls) is to be taken into account, then the design case would have to be copied and the impact load would have to be included here again. The evaluation of the foundation would then be carried out using two design cases in Module work. "
"Why is the shear stiffness reduced to 10% in the RF-LAMINATE module and for the orthotropic material model in RFEM for the shear modulus Gyz ? In my opinion, the shear stiffness in the pane plane Gxy should be reduced here?","The reduction in shear stiffness results from the fact that the fibers perpendicular to each other have very low stiffness and low strength. For this reason, the rolling shear strength of cross laminated timber panels is very small. In the case of cross laminated timber panels, glued side panels are required on boards. The boards are attached lengthways in the x-axis of the coordinate system. The shear stress τyz is compared to the rolling shear strength. The shear stiffness is the same . In the direction of the weak axis (yz plane), the stiffness of the individual boards is significantly lower than in the direction of the main axis (xz plane) and also greater than in the xy plane. "
"During the calculation with RF-/FOUNDATION Pro, I get an error message stating that the foundation dimension is smaller than twice the eccentricity. Why? And what can I do?","The ""equivalent area"" for determining the base stress is determined in RF-FOUNDATION Pro for the bearing failure analysis or base stress analysis. If a foundation dimension is smaller than twice the load eccentricity ""e"", then it is the ""equivalent area"" or ""calculated base area"" cannot be determined. In this case, you will receive the error message mentioned. Most of the time, the problem is that the dimensions of the foundation plate were specified by the user too small. The problem can be solved by manually setting the dimensions larger. Or by setting the ""lay out"" function. "
"When evaluating the support reactions of a slab supported by line supports, it is noticeable that the support reaction pz' does not correspond to the shear force and deviates significantly. What could be the cause for this?","If there are significant deviations, the problem can be caused by the applied bending theory (Mindlin or Kirchhoff). See also FAQ Mindlin Kirchhof "
"In my model, members and surfaces/solids are made of wood. An orthotropic 2D/3D material model has already been created. Now I get an error saying that the material model for cross-section X must be isotropic.","In this case, the orthotropic material model is probably assigned to both the surfaces/solids and the members. However, rods made of wood require an isotropic material model. Accordingly, another wood material must be created and assigned to the corresponding members or cross-sections."
Can I create or generate parallel load combinations for Th. I. Order and Th. II. Order (including imperfections) in RFEM?,"Yes. That works. If the automatic combinatorics is activated in RFEM or RSTAB, e.g. For example, for the ""ULS"" design situation, the LK's are automatically set according to the second order. According to the defined load cases, you get a list of load combinations that are calculated according to Th. II. order. The consideration of the imperfection load cases can also be activated. If now In addition to the existing load combinations according to Th. II. order including imperfections, load combinations according to Th. I. order (without imperfections) are to be generated, an additional combination rule can be created for this purpose. In this additional combination rule, the design situation ""ULS"" can now also be selected. However, the calculation type ""Th. I. Order"" can now be selected and the imperfections deselected. The result is load combinations according to Th. II. order including imperfection (blue marking in the following graphic) and load combinations according to Th. I. order without imperfection (red marking in the following graphic). This procedure can now be used, for example, when working on a part the structure stability verifications according to Th. II. order (including imperfection) are to be performed and individual components, e.g. B. according to the equivalent member or model column method. Optionally, the numbering of the individual LC groups can be controlled in advance in the ""Combination rule"" tab. So e.g. For example, one group starts with LK 100, the second group with LK 200. This allows the user to achieve a better overview or assignment of the LK's. "
created seismic loads manually. How can I now combine these according to the superposition rules of the standard?,"If you have defined load cases with seismic loads and do not want to combine them using the RF-/DYNAM Pro add-on module, you should not use the automatic combinatorics for this. The following steps explain how to define the manual combinatorics: Depending on whether you want to use the SRSS or the CQC rule, you must use this possibly activate in the basic data (only necessary in the case of the CQC rule). Additional parameters must be activated for the CQC rule, this can be set in the load cases. Create one result combination per direction. Add all load cases where you have defined seismic actions in that direction. The type of overlay can then be defined in the calculation parameters.Next, the directions are overlaid in further result combinations. For example, Eurocode 8 specifies the 100/30% rule for this. To do this, add the result combinations of each direction with ""and"" and change the factors to 1.0 for the dominant direction and 0.3 for the other directions. A result combination must be created for each direction. Finally, another result combination is created, which can then be used for the design. In this, the earthquake loads are superimposed with the permanent and live loads (formation of the extraordinary combination). Note that earthquake result combinations must be added with ""or"". "
"Is it possible to renumber load cases, load combinations and result combinations?",This function is available via Extras - Renumber - Move. This is shown in the attached video.
Are the vertical wall surfaces recorded when wind loads are generated via area loads in an open building?,"No, these are not recorded by default. The wind load generation via surface loads always records the wind load orthogonally to the spanned area. For the attached example, however, the load in the wind load area of 0.5kN/m² in the flow of air can be converted relatively easily. However, the wind load can also be generated for any building geometry with the new independent program RWIND Simulation. This offers you the options for wind simulation and for generating wind loads. In connection with the FEM structural analysis software RFEM or the framework program RSTAB, the possibilities can be optimally used. Input The direct transfer of models from RFEM or RSTAB makes it possible to define relevant parameters of the wind directions to be analyzed with height-dependent wind profiles based on a wind standard. This results in the corresponding load cases with additional globally stored parameters. Without RFEM or RSTAB, RWIND Simulation can be operated manually. For this purpose, the data can be imported from STL vector graphics. It is also possible to transfer terrain and buildings in the area to the simulation from STL files. Through the exchange between RFEM or RSTAB and RWIND Simulation, you can easily use the results of the wind analysis as load cases in your usual working environment of RFEM or RSTAB.

How can the associated internal forces of the maximum results in result combinations be displayed in the printout report?,"In RFEM or RSTAB, the associated support reactions / internal forces can be easily read out in a result combination in the tables. This is automatically preset. If these are to be displayed in the printout report, the extreme values must be activated in the associated tables. You can activate this in the selection. In In this example, the extreme values were only activated for the support force Pz, which means that the maximum support forces in the Z direction are displayed with the associated support reactions in the other directions. If a graphical representation is required, you must print the graphic of the displayed load cases or combinations in the printout report. "
"Despite the joint, I get a bending moment My in the ribbed bar. Why?","The member section sizes (e.g. the bending moment My) of the rib member are not only dependent on the defined member end hinges, but also on the surface internal forces in the slab. Enter when entering the rib Provide an integration range for the surface internal forces. The rib internal forces are set from the member section sizes of the eccentrically connected rectangular cross-section and the surface internal forces integrated over the integration width. This now means that you can calculate a bending moment for a ribbed member despite entering member end hinges My can be obtained since the bending moment can come from the integrated surface internal forces. In the Show navigator you can set whether the results should be displayed including the proportion of the surface internal forces (default setting). Or without the portion of the surface internal forces In order to obtain a ""zero passage"" of the moment My in the ribbed member, a line hinge would have to be inserted in the area where the slab is connected to the wall. "
Where can I read stresses in RSTAB?,"RSTAB is a pure framework program and only determines internal forces, deformations and support reactions. In contrast, stresses vary over the cross-section and are calculated at the stress points of a cross-section. This stress determination is carried out in the additional module STEEL performed by calculating existing stresses and comparing them to the limit stresses."
How is the placement direction of the reinforcement defined in RF-CONCRETE surfaces?,"The direction of the longitudinal reinforcement is defined in the ""Reinforcement arrangement"" tab in the 1.4 Reinforcement input dialog. In this case, the reinforcement direction phi-1 by default corresponds to the direction of the local x-axis of the FE element (for results). By default, the direction of the local x-axis of the FE element or surface is the same for the input and for the results. "
How can you carry out a stability analysis for walls in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces?,"There is currently no option to perform a stability analysis in the RF-CONCRETE Surfaces module. However, a simplified design using the nominal curvature method in RF-CONCRETE columns can be carried out with the help of a result member."
"For which application is the ""Determine mode shape of unstable model..."" option in RF-STABILITY suitable?","This function is intended to uncover modeling errors in the system that lead to instability. Such systems can still be calculated with this method and the cause of the instability can be determined graphically. This function is not suitable for the following problems: Calculation aborts due to overloads (stability problems)Determination of buckling and buckling figures If the system is stable and there are only stability problems in the calculation according to Theory II . order occur, all results are 0 with this function. The solution to the problem of instability is discussed in FAQ 3045 received in detail. "
"bought the programs RFEM and RSTAB. In my Dlubal account, however, I only see RFEM (or only RSTAB) in the download area. Why is that?","Whether or not the download for RFEM or RSTAB is displayed in the download area of the Dlubal account depends on whether you have concluded a service contract for the respective product or not. If a service contract has been concluded for the respective product, the links for this product are visible. . If no service contract was concluded, no links are visible.

The calculation of my model delivers unrealistically high voltages in some places. What can be the reason?,"The most common causes are listed below:1. SingularitiesSingularities show up in a limited area by a concentration of the stress-dependent result values. They are due to the methodology of the FEM: theoretically, the rigidity and/or the stress of infinite size are concentrated on an infinitesimally small area. Therefore, singularities occur in particular at punctiform supports, load introduction points, re-entrant corners or in the area of jumps in stiffness. If the result value of the stress peak is larger with a finer FE mesh, the area However, if this voltage peak decreases, there is a high probability of a singularity. Recommendations for dealing with singularity points are contained, for example, in the following articles in our knowledge base:Singularities in the design of reinforced concrete surfacesAvoid singularities at nodal and line supports of slab structures2. Unrealistic support definitionRigid supports (infinitely stiff supports) are in many cases rather unrealistic. It is therefore advisable to depict the supports as elastic supports. In particular, the stiffness of adjacent components should be realistically estimated. The deformation pattern is suitable for checking, possibly with a strong increase, as well as the output of the support reactions or contact stresses. For a better overview, loads that are as simple as possible should be used for checking.3. Incorrect direction definition/ incorrectly defined non-linearitiesAn error in the direction definition, for example of loads, member hinges or line or surface releases, is often the cause of unrealistic behavior. Particularly when using local or rotated coordinate systems as reference systems, particular attention must be paid to the correct definition. Typical examples are incorrectly defined non-linearities in bearings that fail in tension or compression.Incorrectly defined loads can be easily identified by displaying the load. The loads applied for the calculation can be conveniently displayed in the results navigator using the ""Load distribution"" option. Modeling inaccuracies can also lead to incorrect direction definitions. For example, importing a dxf file can result in inaccuracies in the model, for example with nodes that are not on top of each other or lines that are skewed relative to one another.The ""Regenerate model"" function is very helpful for dealing with minimal inaccuracies. Incorrectly defined joints and releases can usually be recognized via the deformation pattern and the internal force curves become. You should also work here with simple loads for checking.4. Model does not correspond to realityIt often happens that not all external or internal influences of a structure to be modeled have been taken into account with sufficient accuracy in the model. Bearings or supporting components may not have been modeled or may have been modeled in the wrong place. It is also important to realistically estimate the stiffness of adjacent components. If this was overestimated or underestimated, the load transfer in the model is sometimes changed significantly. However, a simple check is possible here via the deformation pattern, possibly with a strong increase. With knowledge of the real structure, the following questions can lead to a solution: Is the magnitude of the deformations realistic? Does the quality of the deformation process match my expectations? In the following A suitable example is presented in the Knowledge Base article:Modeling of a base plate considering plate bending and realistic dowel force distribution (nonlinear) "
compare a design for flexural buckling according to the equivalent member method and internal forces according to the first-order theory with a stress calculation according to the second-order theory including imperfections. The differences are very big. What can be the reason?,"While according to the second-order theory the influence of the imperfection increases significantly with increasing normal force and the utilization increases exponentially, in the equivalent member design the influence of the imperfection increases only linearly in relation to the normal force. Therefore, in the case of very heavily or very weakly loaded systems, there are usually major differences between the utilizations according to the first-order theory using the equivalent member method and the second-order theory using the stress analysis."
What does the load application point in RF-/STEEL EC3 Warping Torsion refer to?,"The RF-/STEEL EC3 Warping Torsion add-on module determines the loading from the internal forces with a transfer function, as described in the Knowledge Base article below. In order to also take the point of application of the load into account in the calculation, all shear loads (py, pz) are then related to the selected point of the cross-section. This is not only taken into account when determining the internal forces according to the bending torsion theory, but also in particular when calculating the critical load factor. This procedure can be compared with the input in the RF-/FE-LTB add-on module. "
To which axes do the bearing rotations and bearing eccentricities in RF-/STEEL EC3 Warping Torsion refer?,"The axes to which the support rotations and support eccentricities refer are preset to the local member axes, which can be displayed with a button below the detail window. However, they can also be switched to the global axis system."
How to change the colors of the reinforcement graphics?,"The first two rebars selected for display are displayed in red and blue by default.

"In the fire protection design in RF-CONCRETE Members, acting internal forces, for example My,Ed,fi, are applied that do not correspond to the internal forces of the underlying determination of internal forces. What is the background?","In the fire protection analysis, the acting internal forces are determined again if the thermal expansion of the concrete and the reinforcing steel and the precamber due to the temperature difference are taken into account. Are If the thermal expansion and the precamber are not taken into account, the acting internal forces should correspond to the internal forces of the calculation from RFEM or RSTAB. To what extent it is permissible, the thermal expansion and deactivating cambers must be checked in connection with the underlying standard. "
Which calculation theory is used for insulating glass?,"If insulating glass is selected for the design in RF-Glass, the calculation theory according to III. order set. Due to the existing gas volume in the space between the glass panes, this type of calculation is also necessary and cannot be changed. "
Can a temperature for a surface in the XZ plane also be entered via the height (variable in Z)?,"Yes, this is possible. When applying a new distributed load, you can set ""Temperature"" as the load type. Instead of attaching a constant load profile, a variable load profile (e.g. linear in Z) can be applied. The load variables can be used to control whether a constant temperature or a delta temperature is to be applied. "
Why can't I design an LVL material according to the SIA 265 standard in RF-/TIMBER Pro?,"When selecting the SIA 265 standard in RF-/TIMBER Pro, only materials that are also permitted in the standard can be used for the members to be designed. You can easily find the allowed materials in the material library through the filter of the standard."
"When trying to open an RFEM/RSTAB file, I get the error message ""The central directory was not found in the archive...""

How are stays treated in RF-FORM-FINDING with regard to the prestressing load to be applied? Does the guying have to be assigned a pretensioning force?,"For finding the form, it is primarily important to apply a pre-tension for the membrane and any border cables that may be present. The guyings do not have to be pretensioned.The guyings can be installed as tension rods with their original length (see picture). As a result of the prestressed membrane and edge ropes, the load for the anchoring results in the course of the calculation."
How do I change the preset partial safety factors in CRANEWAY?,"The partial safety factors are set in the general data via the definition of the national appendix of the standard. The predefined national annexes cannot be changed, but you can easily create a user-defined national annex. All standard-specific coefficients can then be adapted here. "
Can I export the form-finding results? For example in a DXF file?,"The result of the form-finding can be exported to a DXF file. There are several options. It For example, the ""Direct export"" to a DXF file can be used.Note that AutoCAD must be started as an application in the background. Alternatively, the export function can be used via the file menu. It is important that the 3D face elements are exported. A direct interface to Autodesk Revit exists unfortunately it doesn't at the moment.But in a webinar on membrane structures, a possible workflow for including the export in a Revit model was shown. See the link below. "
Does Dlubal have solutions for composite bridge construction or perhaps also verification examples or reference objects?,"Unfortunately, we currently do not have any solutions for the design of composite bridges in our range. Therefore, no verification or reference projects are available for this. Basically, however, you can model composite bridges made of steel and concrete in RFEM 5 and use these models, e.g. B. for a determination of internal forces. Unfortunately, we are currently unable to offer solutions for the verification of such bridges according to the relevant standards."
"How can I export my member structure from RSTAB/RFEM so that I can continue to use it in my design program? When exporting to *.dxf format, I only get the centroid lines.","First you should check whether a specific interface for the construction program is not available. If you design with Revit or Tekla, direct interfaces are available to the user. It is also possible to export to DSTV format. This is also supported by many programs. The export to the *.dxf format is of course possible at any time. However, since member structures are basically pure gravity line models to which the information on cross-section and material is only attached, only lines can be exported. However, if you need the member as a 3D body, you can click on the Access export to the Bentley ISM format. It should be noted that the free Bentley Structural Synchronizer is required. A link to this product can be found at the end of the article. The export can easily be called up via ""File"" - ""Export"". The structural synchronizer turns the members into solid models converted. A file with the extension *.ism.dgn is then written. This format is supported by many construction programs."
Is there a separate installation for viewer mode?,"No, there is no separate installation file for the RSTAB or RFEM viewer mode. After the installation, a desktop icon with and without the addition ""Viewer"" is automatically created. There is only one installation file for RSTAB or RFEM. This is to be used, regardless of whether a licensed version, the viewer mode or a test version is to be used. For the stand-alone programs (e.g . B. DUENQ, KRANBAHN, etc.) no viewer mode is available."
How are the site-specific Geo-Zone-Tool data queries for determining the various building loads billed?,"The online service ""Snow load zones, wind zones and earthquake zones"" represents the snow load, wind and earthquake zones for many countries according to the relevant standards on the Google Maps map and outputs the site-specific loads of the respective zone map for the marked point on the map. The location on the map can either be specified using the search function offered on the website or by clicking on the desired location on the map. The connected load determination is linked to the selected point and gives always calculates the site-specific load depending on the local load zone information and the height above sea level. Since our online service is based on the Google Maps services, which are subject to a fee, we only offer our users a limited number of free geo-data queries (load determinations). In the event that this limited number of load determinations is not sufficient, there are our geo-zone tool data query packages. These packages release a certain number of location-specific data queries for all stored contacts of a company. → Geo-Zones-Tool A data query corresponds to a load determination depending on the set zone map (load type) and location on the map. A possible change in the load type leads to another data query due to new zone information. As a result, in the standard case, at least 3 queries are required for determining the local snow, wind and earthquake loads. "
get an error message that Wall type support cannot be defined on a rotated line. How can I fix the problem?,"This message can be caused by a rotated line that was imported from CAD, for example. As soon as all line rotations have been set to 0°, the message should no longer appear."
"I get an implausible result with the expression ""1.#J"" in the RF-/ALUMINUM add-on module. How can I fix this?","This type of result can occur when the cross-section internal forces cannot be determined. The problem in most cases is an incorrectly defined cross-section or the selection of an unsupported cross-section. Please check whether you have selected a cross-section that is permissible for aluminum construction in the additional module. This includes the rolled cross-sections and the parametric thin-walled cross-sections. The HK 120/40/5/5/5/5 cross-section is not a permissible cross-section because it consists of was selected in the area of solid cross-sections (concrete components). Here the cross-section must be changed to TO 120/40/5/5/5/5. It should also be noted that when designing in RF-/ALUMINIUM, a material is selected that also covers material thicknesses that are used for the cross-sections. A material that is only permitted up to t=3 mm cannot be used for a cross-section with t=5 mm."
"entered a line hinge in the middle of the surface, the bending moment is not zero at the line hinge. What can be the cause?","If the line hinge has been defined correctly, the problem can e.g. B. due to an incorrect warehouse definition. . Although the system should apparently be the same, a moment in the middle of the span results from the calculation of the internal forces. In the present case, the cause can already be derived from the error message after the calculation of the load case. There are very large deformations in the lower system, so that this already indicates a faulty bearing of the surface. When checking the line supports, it becomes clear that the lower system twists around the global Y-axis due to the lack of restraint . Ultimately, this also leads to the non-significant internal force progression of the basic internal force mx. If the line support is adjusted, you get the expected result. "
How can I generate the fingerprint (*.*ID file) on our server?,"Please proceed as follows to generate the fingerprint: Open a web browser on the serverEnter the address http: //localhost:1947Now please select the ""Diagnostics"" optionIn the upper right area of the display you will find the ""Create ID File"" button li>Please send us this file."
"When determining the distribution coefficient ζ (zeta), is the exponent n used differently according to the design standard?","Yes, the exponent n is set differently. This can be traced in the calculation details. For EN 1992-1-1, for example, n=2 and for CSA A23.3-14 n=3 is used."
Why do I get different design results for a load combination (LK) and a result combination (EK) in STEEL EC3 despite the same internal forces?,"The difference between a design with EK and LK lies primarily in the moment curve used to calculate the ideal lateral-torsional buckling moment Mcr. In the case of a load combination (LK), the moment curve can be clearly applied for the given load position. In the case of a result combination of the ""+"" type or an EK that does not correspond to the ""constant/or"" type, however, only the enveloping torque curve can be examined. The more unfavorable course (max or min) is then used. As a result, there are less favorable values for the critical load factor.Furthermore, it should be noted in the verification according to Section 6.3.3 EN 1993-1-1 that the moment curve coefficients are set to 1.0 (constant curve) if the moment curve cannot be clearly determined, which can also lead to more conservative results. Conclusion:The internal forces used for the design can be the same in LK and EK, but the torque curve in the result combination is used less favorably to determine the branching value. The EK thus provides a higher utilization when dimensioning with STAHL EC3. "
How can I change the standard / national annex on which the design is based in the additional modules and the stand-alone programs?,The standard and the national appendix are usually set in the top right-hand corner of the additional module or the stand-alone program. In most cases it is also possible to view the coefficients used in a national annex and edit them if necessary.
"I'm designing a beam and I want to ignore the contained torsion in the stability analyzes using the filters described in Knowledge Base Article #001498 .I define a filter, but the torsion warning appears again in the same x-location. Do the design internal forces change or what is the reason?","The design internal forces do not change because no change in loading has been defined. The torsional stresses are calculated once with Gamma M1 1.0 and once with Gamma M1 according to the national annex, which means that the warning can appear twice. If the filter is increased again in the following, a different x-point (or load from LF/LK/EK) can also become decisive for the warning."
Can loads on a glass pane from the structure be considered in the RF-GLASS calculation?,"Loads from the structure are automatically taken into account in the design in RF-GLASS if the global calculation type and the associated load case have been selected.With the ""Local"" calculation type, the system is considered separately and therefore only the loads acting directly on the surface are taken into account.Loads from the support system must therefore be applied manually with this type of calculation."
How can prestressed cables be taken into account in RF-/DYNAM Pro?,"The pretensioning of ropes has a significant influence on the behavior of a structure. This must therefore also be taken into account in the dynamics. In the natural vibration cases of the module, there is the option of considering changes in stiffness based on a load case. This option rewrites the geometric stiffness matrix for the mode analysis. In order not to falsify the results or to take any undesired effects into account, it is important that the load case to be imported only contains the prestress and no other loading. If a time history analysis is to be carried out, it must be ensured that the implicit Newmark analysis and the explicit analysis do not use the natural vibration cases, but the calculation parameters are defined directly in the dynamic load case. Therefore, the preload must also be taken into account here. The ""steady state"" function is available for this purpose. With this option, the stiffness changes resulting from the preload are taken into account. There is also an interesting article on this topic."
How can I display the contact stresses on a contact volume?,"The result values referred to as ""contact stresses"" in RFEM are by definition reserved for surfaces with surface supports (see RFEM manual). Contact volumes can instead be evaluated like standard solids. According to the definition of the axis system of the contact solid, the stresses in the contact direction can also be displayed. It should be noted that in order to evaluate contact solids, the ""Remove contact solid from display"" option in the Show navigator must be deactivated. "
would like to use a cross-section that does not exist in the cross-section library of RSTAB and RFEM. Is there a way to get the cross section?,"With the additional modules SHAPE-THIN (thin-walled cross-sections) and DICKQ (thick-walled cross-sections), almost any cross-section can be modeled. The cross-sections are entered graphically, in tabular form or by importing a DXF file. With SHAPE-THIN and DICKQ there is an option to connect to RFEM and RSTAB. The cross-sections can thus be imported into RSTAB and RFEM, calculated and designed in the add-on modules (THIN-THIN cross-sections only)."
How do you know that the RF-CUTTING flattening process has found convergence?,"The geometrically non-linear leveling process adopts the real mesh geometry of the flat, kinked, single-curved or double-curved surface components from the selected pattern sets and levels these surface components by minimizing the distortion energy, assuming a defined material behavior. The iterative calculation used depends on the parameters in the ""Calculation parameters""/ Tab ""Cut patterns"" controlled. The parameter "" Maximum number of iterations"" limits the scope of the calculation and stops the process when the set maximum iteration is reached. If the convergence criterion is not in the convergence range when the maximum iteration is reached, depending on the ""Tolerance for convergence criterion"" parameter, the program issues error message 10154. If the program does not issue an error message, you can assume proper convergence. The error can usually be solved by adjusting the leveling geometry or increasing the maximum number of iterations. "
How can the RF-Glass add-on module be started?,"The RF-GLASS add-on module, similar to other add-on modules, is started from the projector navigator or called up in the menu bar under the item Add-on modules.All other inputs for the design can then be made in the module. "
How to display node masses?,"The material weight W can be displayed for members (RSTAB) or members, surfaces and volumes (RFEM). To do this, simply select the entire structure or part of it and right-click to open the context menu. There you will find the entry ""Focus and info..."". The However, this does not yet result in nodal masses. The RF-/DYNAM Pro natural vibrations add-on module can be used to generate nodal masses. Here, a natural vibration case can be created in which the mass z. B. only acts in the Z direction. After the natural vibration case has been calculated, the ""node masses"" are available in the result tables of RF-/DYNAM Pro. In RF-/DYNAM Pro, the nodal loads can optionally be converted into masses by applying the force components of the respective load case for the natural vibration case calculation. "
No result values are displayed in the table for individual areas. What can be the reason?,"For surfaces in RFEM, the results are always output in the grid points. With an unfavorable grid setting it can happen that no such result is available for individual areas. As a result, no result value is displayed in the graphic and the area is also missing in the result table. In general, it is sufficient to reduce the distance between the grid points. For optimal output and graphic representation, the area grid can also be adjusted in the editing window of the area. To do this, double-click the surface to open the ""Edit surface"" dialog. There, select the ""Grid"" tab. The following basic settings for the area grid can be adjusted here: Raster type Cartesian or polarNumber and spacing of the grid points in each direction If a custom grid type is selected, the following additional options can be specified: Grid originGrid rotationAlignment of grid axis "
How can I adjust the sheet size for the printout report?,"The default print format is DIN A4 in portrait format. These settings can be changed using the ""Set printer"" button, which can be found in the printout report, among other things. Editing the sheet size and format of individual pages of the printout report is not yet possible."
I cannot understand the internal forces for the initial strain function from another LC / other LK. How is this function mapped internally?,"The function transfers the deformation from one LF or LK to the other LF or another LK. The internal forces or the stress states are not transferred. Insofar as the load case or the load case combination is based on the same static system, there should be no internal forces worth mentioning. The FE division in the system can have an influence here and should be checked if necessary. If the initial strain is transferred to a load case or a load case combination that is based on another static system, additional internal forces can result from the prevented deformation (constraint). In the example, the initial strain of two consecutive single-span beams is transferred to a continuous beam. The deformation of the intermediate support is prevented and a moment develops. The size of the resulting moment can be understood by cutting the system free and applying the prevented deformation as forced deformation on the load side."
How can the standard case tables for the base stress analysis be applied in RF-/FOUNDATION Pro?,"First, ""DIN"" must be set as the national appendix. This means that the option ""For the standard case according to DIN EN 1997-1, A6.10"" is available. The user can set here whether the soil is ""cohesive"" or ""non-cohesive"". In the ""Details"" you can then make further settings for the standard case tables and view the values for the permissible soil pressure. The values in the standard case table cannot be edited."
"What options are there for determining the ideal lateral-torsional buckling moment for any cross-section and system/load using RSTAB or RFEM? Can flat steel (corbels, flat steel stringers of stairs) also be designed?","The add-on modules RF-/STEEL EC3 Warping Torsion (add-on for module RF-/STEEL EC3) and RF-/FE-LTB (separate add-on module) are particularly suitable for the stability design of any cross-section.Using the calculated critical value, critical loads can be determined and a second-order analysis can be carried out."
How can a foundation for lifting loads be verified?,"The design of lifting loads is performed in RF-/FOUNDATION Pro under the designation ""Check of floating"". This does not only mean the floating of the foundation in relation to the groundwater level, but also the occurrence of lifting or negative bearing forces. The proof of floating can be activated in the ""Details"" of the module or is standard when creating a new one Design case active. If the dimensions of the foundation are to be designed, then the program increases the foundation dimensions iteratively until the proof of floating is observed."
How can I adjust profiles inserted in SHAPE-THIN?,"If you want to change individual elements of an inserted profile, this is possible using various methods. 1. Selecting a different profile from the cross-section libraryIf you edit the profile or select a different one, the associated elements will also change. The specified cross-section properties can be changed here using the 'Parametric input' button. This option is particularly useful if the basic geometry and symmetry of the original cross-section should be retained. Sheet thicknesses and total height or total width can be adjusted very easily in this way. 2. Break down the profile into individual elementsIn this way, individual, independent elements are generated from the inserted profile. These can then be edited like normally created elements.This procedure makes sense, for example, if the basic geometry of the original cross section is to be changed."
Why isn't the bearing failure analysis performed in RF-/FOUNDATION Pro?,"Please check the load.The base of the foundation is probably not over-pressurized due to the uplifting load.In this case, RF-/FOUNDATION Pro gives a verification criterion of ""-"" with the note ""Verification not required"". out."
Why can't the thickness of individual cross-section elements be changed in SHAPE-THIN?,"These cross-section elements belong to an inserted profile and therefore cannot be edited individually. If you want to change individual elements of an inserted profile, this can be done using various methods: 1. Selecting a different profile from the cross-section libraryIf you edit the profile or select a different one, the associated elements will also change. The specified cross-section properties can be changed using the 'Parametric input' button. This option is particularly useful if the basic geometry and symmetry of the original cross-section should be retained. Sheet thicknesses and overall height or overall width can be adjusted very easily in this way, for example. 2. Break down the profile into individual elementsIn this way, individual, independent elements are generated from the inserted profile. These can then be edited like normally created elements. This procedure makes sense, for example, if the basic geometry of the original cross section is to be changed."
"With a result combination as an envelope, is it possible to output the associated internal forces for a maximum or minimum internal force in the case of surface internal forces? ","For members, the associated internal forces are shown in a result combination in addition to the maximum and minimum values. Due to the large amount of data, only the maximum and minimum values for each grid point are shown for area internal forces. The associated internal forces for a maximum or minimum value are not displayed.For the result evaluation, RFEM calculates all load cases, load combinations and result combinations contained in the result combination and lists the maximum and minimum values accordingly. If you want to have the associated internal forces for a result value of the result combination, you have to search for the elements contained in the result combination and compare them with the corresponding value. Once the load case or load combination is found, it is also found for each grid point the associated internal forces of the area are output.You can also use the COM interface for a faster evaluation."
"What is the difference between ""with shear connection"" and ""without shear connection"" for the composite profiles?","With the ""with shear connection"" option, the stiffness of the profile is calculated as a coherent profile. This means that the thickness t* depicts a completely welded profile. With the ""without shear connection"" option, two independent profiles are calculated."
Can member section sizes also be output with reference to the global coordinate system?,Member section sizes are always output with reference to the member axes or the principal axes. An output with reference to the global coordinate system or a user-defined coordinate system is not possible.
"design surfaces in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces and get a high minimum reinforcement in some areas as a result of the design in SLS. In other areas, however, the minimum reinforcement is significantly lower. What is the reason?","According to the default setting, the determination of the minimum reinforcement is based on a stress distribution in the tension zone before the first crack forms (coefficient kc according to EN 1992-1-1 7.3.2 (7.2.)), which from the outer load depends. This means that according to the default setting, kc is variable.Depending on the stress state (e.g. pure bending, bending and tension, bending and compression and pure tension), the minimum reinforcement vary over the area.The default setting can also be adjusted. A bending constraint (kc = 0.4) or a centric constraint (kc = 1.0) can be selected.As soon as a constant value for kc is taken as a basis, the minimum reinforcement is independent of the external load and is applied uniformly over the component.In this context, a selection can also be made , in which direction the constraint should be taken into account"

"Is it possible to change the effective lengths in the TIMBER Pro, STEEL EC3, etc. modules via Excel?","Yes, that is possible. However, it is very important to use the correct identical format and the identical allocation of the associated members when importing into Excel. This works great if the lengths are first exported to EXCEL and then imported again. This is shown in the attached video. There are more options for changing the effective lengths using the additional module RF-/COM. The modules mentioned are linked to this add-on module."

This mask can be switched on in the Details - Results."
Why is the transverse force Vz on a rib directly above the bearing lower than just next to it?,"In the case of a ribbed member, the shear force Vz is made up of the member section sizes of the eccentrically connected rectangular member and the surface internal forces integrated over the defined integration width. A decreasing value the shear force Vz directly above the bearing mostly results from the course of the surface internal forces (basic internal force vx or vy) . See the course of the basic internal forces vy. A ""zero crossing"" of the surface internal forces results over the bearing. This ""zero crossing"" results from the smoothing of the surface internal forces within the surface and is also reflected in the section sizes of the ribbed member. To avoid the ""problem"", the continuous area above the bearing can be divided into an area before and after the bearing. When integrating the surface internal forces, the smoothed progression of the surface internal forces ""within an area "" scheduled. So if you enter an area before and after the support, you will receive a result value without zero crossing exactly at the point next to the nodal support."
Can I have the cross-section values output via the RF/COM interface?,"The cross-section values of a cross-section can be output using the COM interface.

"In connection with the nonlinear calculation, the crack depth is displayed in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces. What is behind this size?","The depth of the crack indicates over which height in the cross-section damage, or in other words a change in stiffness, has taken place. The non-linear calculation and the associated layering of the FE element is the basis for the output of this value. The crack depth is output on each side and in the two main directions of the cracks. The direction can also be understood via the trajectories ϕ,hw."
How can I account for holes in steel bars?,"For the calculation of members, you can define cross-sections in RSTAB and RFEM that create a member with regularly arranged openings (circular or honeycomb-shaped).If you want to position a single opening in a steel girder, you can use the ""Disassemble member into Apply Surface"" and then place the opening as a circular opening in the web surface."
Can the form-finding of the membranes also be done without taking into account the flexible substructure?,"In general, the form-finding process in RFEM always takes all model specifications into account. During form-finding, the elastic supporting elements on the membrane react with deformations in the direction of the applied membrane tensile stress. The integral process passes the prestressed model to the subsequent calculation when the forces of all deformed elements are in equilibrium with the membrane geometry under the specified prestress. However, the resilience of the supporting structure for pure form-finding can be suppressed via a support definition with the non-linearity ""Only form-finding construction stage"" (also called form-finding support) at the membrane edges. In this case, the form-finding process results in a form whose prestress is in equilibrium with the set form-finding support forces and remaining edge reactions. For the static calculation of all other load cases and load combinations, the form-finding supports are deactivated and the form-finding support forces are applied as external loads to maintain global equilibrium in the overall model. Due to the removal of the supports, the membrane reacts with the flexible supporting structure in the subsequent considerations (LF and LK). Without additional load, this reaction resembles a relaxation with a concomitant reduction in prestress "
Is it possible to apply a user-defined value scale to all load cases or load combinations?,"Unfortunately, automatic transfer to all load cases or load combinations is not possible. However, there is the option of saving the user-defined settings and importing them into other load cases. To do this, the dialog for editing the value and color scales must be opened and the user-defined settings made there become. These settings can then be saved via ""Save..."". This value scale is now available in all load cases and combinations and can be selected."

"How are the long-term losses due to creep and shrinkage, relaxation of the prestressing steel and due to elastic deformation considered in RF-TENDON or RF-TENDON Design?","The long-term losses are taken into account in the external module RF-TENDON Design immediately before the verification. The internal forces in the considered design sections are recalculated using the long-term losses. The interim results and the individual parts of the losses can be understood under ""Effective phase""."
Which smoothing is used in the output of the internal forces via the COM interface considered?,"The smoothing is an interpolation of the existing internal forces. This is explained in the associated articleg. As such, the internal forces are displayed in post-processing. All internal forces at each FE node are always output via the COM interface. With the result example from the SDK (FAQ) these settings are examined.However, it is possible to distinguish between grid and FE mesh nodes in the output of the results. "
"In the case of an imperfection, I get the warning message 12211 that members have different rotations. What can I do?","Imperfections are applied parallel to the local y-axis or z-axis of a member. If a set of members is selected as the reference for the imperfection, all members contained in the set of members should be oriented in the same way and the set of members should be straight. To check whether the members are all parallel to one another, you can use the ""Select Special"" > ""Staffs"" > ""parallel to staff"". to use. Please watch the video. If a member is not parallel, you should check the coordinates of the nodes and align them if necessary. It is also possible, provided no other members are connected to the node, to simply pull the end nodes of the non-parallel member towards each other."

Can I carry out a fire protection analysis for a rib?,"No, unfortunately this is not possible. In the current development status of RFEM and RSTAB, you can only design rectangular and circular cross-sections with the add-on module RF-CONCRETE Members or CONCRETE. If ribbed bars and regular bars are selected in a reinforcement set for the design in the RF-CONCRETE Members add-on module, the ribbed bars are automatically removed from this reinforcement set. They contain a note on this. If only one rib member is selected for the design in a reinforcement set, you will receive a message that the fire protection analysis is not possible for this cross-section type. See the graphic below: "
Can I use a test version or student version of RFEM 5 on a virtual machine?,"Unfortunately, single-seat licenses cannot be run on virtual machines. Licensing is not possible via the USB dongle or via a softlock license (student license). With the test or trial version and student version of RFEM 5 or RSTAB 8 is a time-limited version that is controlled via a softlock. Therefore, the test or trial version of RFEM 5 or RSTAB 8 cannot be tested on a virtual machine. In general, the operation of a licensed version of RFEM 5 or RSTAB 8 possible on a virtual machine. However, a network license would be required for this. The same also applies to the test versions of the stand-alone programs SHAPE-THIN, RX-HOLZ, FE-BEUL, KRANBAHN and VERBUND-TR.

How can I fix error #1663 about missing rib input in a member definition?,"In RFEM there are rib members for modeling beams, ribs and T-beams. These supporting structural units always consist of a flat panel section and a supporting cross-section that is eccentric to the panel. With the specification of the eccentric load-bearing cross-section, the ribbed member combines the complete unit of flat plate cross-section and rod-shaped support cross-section with output of the internal forces depending on the effective plate width for the entire package. → Modeling and determination of internal forces of beams, ribs and T-beams The error message no. 1663 appears if at least one member with the member type ""rib"" is not assigned a connecting surface can be.

"made a wall with a basic reinforcement (diameter 12 mm, distance 15 cm, inside and outside the same). This would result in an existing basic reinforcement of 7.54 cm²/m per side. However, the module only shows me half (3.77 cm²/m) as the existing basic reinforcement on the inside and outside. Why?","You probably entered the wall as a 2D model. If you entered the wall as a If you enter a 2D model, you can only enter a symmetrical reinforcement on the inside and outside in RF-CONCRETE surfaces. In the input dialog 1.4 of In RF-CONCRETE surfaces you will find only one reinforcement layer, in which ""top"" and ""bottom"" are combined. If you now specify a reinforcement of 7.54 cm²/m in a 2D model, you will get an existing basic reinforcement of 3.77 cm²/m in the results table 2.1, since RF-CONCRETE surfaces are applied half on the inside and half on the outside. If you now want to consider a reinforcement of 7.54 cm²/m per side of the wall, you must specify a reinforcement of 15.08 cm²/m directly for a 2D model. This would result in the desired reinforcement of 7.54 cm²/m per side. If you enter a 3D model instead of the 2D model (setting in the Basic data of the model), then you can make the settings for the top and bottom of the surface separately in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces. "
What do the numbers in the verifications in the design modules mean?,"These numbers are internal numbers and are not stored in the relevant standards. Depending on the existing internal forces and parameters (stability, fire...) a different verification results. These numbers can be helpful, for example, when you export the proofs to Excel in order to filter them. There is no list for these numbers."
Why does the form-finding process warp the membrane surfaces into each other?,"The form-finding draws the surfaces into one another, since the defined prestressing does not meet at the same angle at the boundary line between the two membranes and consequently the affected FE nodes are not in equilibrium with the edge reactions. Here the FE nodes of the membrane surfaces move in the direction of the remaining resultant until the form-finding process finds a solution within the tolerance limit. Since this solution can usually only be achieved with a large displacement of the FE nodes in space, the surfaces assigned to the FE nodes seem to ""swim"" into each other. This behavior leads to an unfavorable FE mesh arrangement in connection with a singular membrane force distribution. In this case, the prestress must be adjusted to achieve equilibrium or an element must be arranged at the limit situation to absorb forces from the imbalance. "
Is it also possible to enter surface loads in RFEM in the direction of a user-defined coordinate system on a projected surface?,"No, both the normal area loads and the free loads can only be defined on the local area axis or in relation to the global axis system. It is not possible to specify the load direction in relation to a user-defined coordinate system."
"For the min/max support forces, only the maximum forces are displayed in the graphical output, although I have both displayed for the result combination. Why is that?","You have probably activated the ""Absolute extreme value for result combinations"" option in the result navigator. This means that only the absolute largest value from the two is displayed. "
I have several embedded surfaces which have line hinges underneath each other. Is the bedding also applied in the area of the line hinges?,"There you can see that the same contact stress occurs at every point on the surfaces and that the bedding springs have therefore been correctly applied everywhere. Since line hinges are line releases internally, the same applies to line releases."
"After installing RFEM 5.20.01 or RSTAB 8.20.01, our network license no longer works. What can we do?","With the release of customer version X.20.01, the license drivers from GEMALTO were also replaced. With the driver update, GEMALTO closes a security gap. It is therefore necessary to install the new drivers on the server. Proceed as follows:Load Download the drivers: http://download.dlubal.com/?file=Sentinel_LDK_GUI_setup.zip Quit the DLUBAL programs on the clients. Install the new drivers on the server.

Can I carry out a design for a wood-concrete composite section?,"Unfortunately, no, that is not possible for us. However, there is the possibility to design at least the joist of a wood-concrete composite cross-section with the RF-/TIMBER Pro module. To do this, the concrete slab must be defined as a new material in the material database under the material group ""Wood"". In addition to the dimensioning of the beam, this option also offers the possibility of the stresses via to get the cross-section at each point. This FAQ explains how the voltages are output. Even if this does not deal with the design of a wood-concrete composite cross-section in its entirety, the user at least has a statement about the existing stresses and can carry out the design with it. "
Is it possible to display the stresses of hybrid timber cross-sections in RFEM and RSTAB?,"Unfortunately, a graphical output of the voltages is not possible. These can only be entered numerically in RF-/TIMBER Pro can be determined. This option is available in the add-on module of both RFEM and RSTAB."
Why can't I select the middle node of an arc as an auxiliary node?,"The center node of a line always refers to the property of the line and not the member. Therefore it is unfortunately not possible to use the center node of the line as an auxiliary node. Using the command ""Create new node as auxiliary node"", the node can be created directly in the dialog generate. The effort is therefore identical to directly ""picking"" the node."
"To evaluate the results, I created a section through surfaces of the structure. In the result history, however, this cut is displayed longer than it is. What can be the reason?","A cut can go through an entire structure and returns results on faces that are cut through. It is important to define the surfaces on which the section should display results.A section was defined in such a way that all intersected surfaces (default setting) are output. In this case, the two walls are also cut through and its results are therefore appended to the result curv. If the section is only to be displayed on certain areas, the desired surfaces are to be defined in the ""Edit section"" dialog. The section is then displayed as desired in the result curve."
How can I determine the snow drift for a row of roofs in the snow load generator? ,"Snow drifts according to EN 1991-1-3 according to 5.3.4 (3) can be generated with the load generator. In addition to the load cases for unblown snow, the load cases for blown snow can also be defined quickly. To do this, a separate generated load must be created for each section of the roof. In addition, the sides on which a drift occurs must be selected in the load generator (see video). "
"For RF-CONCRETE Columns, I get a ratio >1 for the fire protection analysis. How can the proof in the module be fulfilled?","The module determines the required reinforcement for the load-bearing capacity. The fire protection verification is carried out as verification based on the determined reinforcement. The reinforcement is not increased in this course. If the verification is not fulfilled, either a higher reinforcement can be defined manually or the concrete cover can be adjusted to prevent the applied reinforcement from being damaged too much by the fire."
How can I connect the partial cross-sections to form a total cross-section?,"In SHAPE-THIN you have the option of connecting independent cross-section parts using so-called null elements. This gives you a total cross-section, which you can then use in RSTAB or RFEM for the design.Zero elementsA thickness t must be assigned to each element. This value represents the actual thickness of the cross-section part for full transmission of normal actions. In addition, the effective thickness t* controls the shear transmission in ""artificial"" connection elements with a thickness t = 0. These zero elements serve to create a shear-resistant connection between two elements that do not have a common node. The definition of a shear thickness t* > 0 is required for null elements that are not touched along their entire length by normal elements (t > 0)."
Where can I change the font sizes in the printout report?,"All font sizes and fonts that are displayed in the printout report can be specified via the ""Page setup"" dialog. There are relatively small standard fonts for normal and Column headings provided. Nevertheless, you should be careful when changing the default Arial font sizes: With larger fonts, the entries do not always fit into the intended columns and may be truncated. "
The RF-/JOINTS timber - steel to timber add-on module reports that the member length is too short. What is the minimum length required and how can I work around the problem?,"In order to define a rod dowel connection, the add-on module requires a minimum length of the rods. This is 42cm. If a member is shorter, the message ""Member is too short"" appears in the ""1.2 Nodes and Members"" window. However, the component is often interrupted by intermediate nodes and this consists of several bars. In such cases, the component can remain as a member in RFEM and the nodes can be used with the ""Set node 'On line'"" function. The baton is not shared. All members connected to these nodes are then also connected to each other, even if the member is not divided. As an alternative, you can also use the ""Split member"" function with the ""Don't split the line, just set a new node on the line"" option."
How to change the page format in a 3D PDF?,"The default print format is DIN A4 in portrait format. These settings can be changed using the ""Page format and orientation for 3D PDF"" button, which can be found in the settings for the graphic printout (see Illus. 1)."
How can you smooth non-continuous boundary lines of membrane cuts?,"The perimeter of membrane cuts is described using boundary lines. These boundary lines can be formed by globally defined boundary lines from the assigned membrane surfaces orcutting lines introduced later to divide the blanks on the membrane surfaces. The cuts can only consist of global line definitions, only subsequently introduced cutting lines or mixtures of both types. The Global boundary lines are untouchable due to their fixed geometry description (arc, circle, spline, etc.) and are also implemented as such when determining the planar sections. Subsequently introduced section lines, on the other hand, are based on the FE mesh in the section line specification associated faces and have no effect on the meshing itself. The cutting units surrounded by boundary and section lines adopt the FE mesh of the assigned surfaces for levelling. Since the cutting lines run independently of the global meshing in the edge area over the FE elements themselves, the edges of the original FE elements cannot be used here to describe the cutting limitation. In this case, the affected FE elements in the section line area are divided using the section lines. The FE elements are divided either in the middle or just at the edge, depending on the orientation of the section line. Since the splitting up of the FE elements at the edge in particular can cause geometric difficulties, a certain tolerance limit is set for the decision. This bound controls the critical length ratio between the FE edge length cut off with the cutting line and the original FE edge length. If the ratio is smaller than the given bound value, the intersection line is warped to the original FE node. This fact can lead to an ""irritation"" of the section line in the case of a section line running just past the FE element edges. This situation is optimized by reducing the tolerance limit shown."
How do I activate the form-finding of a membrane surface?,"Form-finding with prestressing can be activated in the basic data for the surface using the ""Edit stiffness parameters"" button. The ""Form-finding"" tab is visible with the activation of the RF-FORM-FINDING module (in the model general data) for surfaces that have one of the following stiffness types: StandardOrthotropicMembraneMembrane - Orthotropic In general, the program automatically activates form-finding with a default prestress for surfaces with the stiffness type 'Membrane' and 'Membrane - Orthotropic'. → Activation of the RF-FORM-FINDING module"
How can I check in my FE model whether the loads I have applied are correctly introduced into the model?,"The control fields in the ""Load distribution"" navigator entry can be used to display the forces and moments that the FE nodes or FE elements receive from the loads entered. The forces of the FE elements leave related to the global XYZ axis system or to the local xyz surface axes. The entered loads can be checked using the network loads. In the case of free concentrated loads, for example, it can be checked whether the load acts on all surfaces that are specified in the list of surfaces.The FE mesh size of the model can be important for line loads and free loads. If, for example, a geometrically small free rectangular load is applied to a surface with a coarse FE mesh, this results in the load being distributed over a much larger surface."
"When determining the effective cross-section values according to EN 1993-1-1, EN 1993-1-5 or EN 1999-1-1, SHAPE-THIN issues the warning message that the effective widths are only determined for straight elements. What does that mean?",The cross-section class is defined according to EN 1993-1-1 or EN 1999-1-1defined by the maximum width-thickness ratio c/t or b/t of the cross-section parts subjected to compression. EN 1993-1- 1 resp. EN 1999-1-1 name only different straight c/t or b/t parts. Classification and determination of the effective widths is therefore not possible for curved c/t or b/t parts.

How do I determine the center of stiffness of my system?,"With the program RFEM it is possible to determine the center of gravity of a system. This is explained in this FAQ. However, the center of gravity should not necessarily be confused with the center of stiffness. This can be determined with the program SHAPE-THIN according to the theory of stiffening systems. In the following Webinar, the practical application of the stiffness center will also be discussed of the seismic design. To determine the center, it is also possible as a third and last option to consider the stiffness with a stiffness model in RFEM. In this series of technical articles, this is explained in the will soon be explained in the following articles."
How can singularities on membrane surfaces from form-finding be avoided?,"Singular reactions are induced by inappropriate form-finding information on the edges of the membrane and an unfavorable FE mesh. There is a rope on a membrane edge with unfavorable form-finding settings (too much sag or too little force), the membrane surface retracts unusually in the form-finding process and thus results in a non-optimally arranged FE mesh with correspondingly singular force reactions. In this case, the form-finding settings of the membrane and the edge element must be adjusted to each other. The form-finding process starts with the initial FE mesh arrangement. If this arrangement is already unfavorable in advance and does not correspond to the necessary shape parameters, the force corresponding to the shape found is also negatively influenced that the initial mesh corresponds to all shape parameters. The graphical representation of the mesh quality before and after shape-finding can be activated in the show navigator. → Power Quality"
Are the loads in plan view oriented with a cross down and those with a circle up?,"The viewing direction decides whether a load is represented by a cross or a circle. If the line of sight follows the load, a cross is displayed. However, if the viewing direction is opposite to the load direction, then a circle is displayed."
How can you graphically visualize the different surface supports and display them in the printout report?,"In the Project Navigator - Show the Colors in graphic by -> Select visibility. In addition, the visibility for surfaces must be set according to supports in the project navigator - views. The table with the surface supports and the colored representation can then be displayed in the printout report of the area storage including a legend."
Why is the compensated cutting length of the membrane area not compatible with the defined compensation?,"The integral leveling process in RF-CUTTING does not level each cut individually, but the complete model geometry in one step. The line type of the respective cutting units also has an effect on the neighboring cuts. In the case of a welding line between two cuts, the program ensures that the lines are the same in the connection area. The geometry of the cuts is determined in such a way that the relevant edge lengths of the cuts are identical. The ""boundary line"" line type allows independent consideration of the subsequent cut units. The length of the border lines in the neighboring area can vary. Basically, the following conditions apply to the cutting units: compensation of the area,compensation of the border line andBorder line typetogether. These requirements are precisely implemented numerically in the integral calculation. Especially with cuts in the edge area, the process can usually not determine a generally valid cut shape due to too many boundary conditions. In this case the program approaches an optimal solution. The affected sections are particularly noticeable due to their curvature compared to the non-compensated solution. Due to the greater modification, these sections also deviate slightly from the defined compensation specifications, but are in balance with all other sections due to the overall calculation. → Levelling process "
Can deformations and internal forces of joints be evaluated?,"Since RFEM version 5.17, there has been a graphic (only for line hinges and line releases) and a table for this purpose. The latter can be found in the following tables: 4.45 Line Hinges - Deformations4.46 Line Hinges - Forces4.47 Member Hinges - Deformations 4.48 Member hinges - Forces4.49 Node releases - Deformations4.50 Node releases - Forces4.51 Line releases - Deformations4.52 Line releases - Powers"
Over what length is the edge line compensation distributed in the area?,"There is no fixed length defined in the program for the distribution of edge line compensation. Rather, the compensation is defined at the edge line nodes and reacts in connection with the integral leveling depending on the geometry and stiffness. In the calculation, the integral leveling takes into account all compensation expansions on the surface and at the edges with the expansions of the leveling itself. → Levelling process "
Can values be read from the table to use them for a parametric input?,"Values can be read from the table with the entry ""&refcell"" with the syntax ""$table number(cell designation)"". The length is given in Table ""1.17 Bars"" in cell L1. This value can now be used in the parameter list or in the formula editor. It is not possible to read out cells from the result table because of the circular reference."
How can I flatten a shape found with RF FORM-FINDING?,The RFEM add-on module RF is required for this -CUT necessary. This calculates and organizes cutting patterns for membrane constructions. The boundary conditions of the cropping patterns on the curved geometry are captured via the boundary lines and independent planar or geodesic intersection lines. Detailed information can be found in the links below and in the videos.

What is meant by the masonry group in the material library for masonry according to EN 1996-1-1?,"According to the geometric requirements of the bricks, they are divided into groups 1 - 4. All geometric requirements for the groups of bricks are listed in EN 1996-1-1 Table 3.1, among others. An example of the assignment of the groups according to the total percentage of holes (% of the gross volume) for bricks looks like this:Group 1 (all bricks)≤ 25 Group 2vertical hole portion > 25; ≤ 55 Group 3vertical hole fraction ≥ 25; ≤ 70 Group 4horizontal hole proportion > 25; ≤ 70 "
Where can the reference height for the reduction coefficients of the snow load according to SIA 260 be defined?,"The reference height can be defined in the coefficients for the SIA 260 standard. These are set in the basic data. The desired reference height is located in the ""Combination coefficients"" tab."
"The calculation of my model does not converge, what can I do?","If a model has many degrees of freedom or there are multiple stable or metastable states, minimal constraint on free translations or rotations of joints or bearings can induce faster convergence.A minimal constraint here means, that, for example, a small displacement spring of 0.01 kN/m is applied to a nodal support that can be moved freely in the global x-direction. The same applies to the rotations. The size of the value depends heavily on the system to be modeled. In a miniature model, for example, the value of 0.01 kN/m can have too great an influence. Here, the translations in the y and z directions are to be blocked, but all other degrees of freedom are freely movable. The small torsional and displacement springs help to achieve convergence faster in the calculation."
How does the leveling process take the compensation into account when determining the cutting pattern?,"The leveling process in the RF CUTTING module is an iterative process that levels the respective cutting areas by minimizing the distortion energy, assuming an assigned material behavior. Described simply, the method presses the initial geometry in a press, assuming a friction-free contact together until the stresses from the planarization are in equilibrium with each other. → See video Since this process captures the complete mechanics of the curved component, the compensation can be shown here directly as an applied strain load are also taken into account. Because in the RF CUTTING algorithm the expansions from the compensation specification interact with the expansions from the leveling, this type of compensation consideration is not included to compare to the usual flat scaling of the uncompensated crops. The consideration of the complete ""cutting mechanics"" with all elongation terms promises a very high-quality cutting geometry. The integral leveling process creates a coordinate system (warp and weft direction) from the average alignment before leveling of the FE elements and uses the initially specified coordinate system to describe the compensation strain and stiffness, regardless of the respective position of the FE elements in space and their coordinate system orientation. Consequently, the comparison shown in the video is only valid for an isotropic linear elastic membrane model. "
"What does the term ""edge strip mortar"" mean when I use ""masonry"" as the material with the 1996-1-1 standard?","Edge strip mortaring occurs when the bricks in a wall are laid not just on one strip of mortar, but on two. The mortar is to be applied to the outer edges of the bearing surfaces of the bricks. Restrictions in the load-bearing capacity are to be expected as a result of edge strip mortaring, as unfavorable stress profiles occur in the wall.The respective national appendix regulates whether edge strip mortaring may be used in a European country. The execution of masonry using edge strip mortar is excluded in the German National Annex. The horizontal joints must therefore always be fully mortared in Germany. "
Is there a simple way to prevent RF-SOILIN from recalculating the bedding for each load change in the relevant load case? ,"No, this is not possible. The calculation of the subgrade parameters in RF-SOILIN runs iteratively. For the first iteration step it is necessary that the start values for the bedding parameters are selected internally by the program. With these initial values, a finite element analysis of the FE model can be performed in RFEM. The distribution of the bed pressure is available as a result. The soil pressure of the first iteration step is used as an input variable in the RF-SOILIN calculation. Together with the constrained modulus of the soil layers entered, the settlement can be calculated for each finite element. The subgrade parameters are then calculated from the settlement and base pressure. In the next iteration step, the new subgrade parameters replace the old ones and a new finite element analysis is started, which in turn provides a new base pressure distribution. As a convergence criterion, the new base pressure distribution is compared with the old one. As long as the deviation exceeds a certain convergence limit, the new base pressure distribution in RF-SOILIN is included in the calculation of new subgrade parameters. When the deviation of the distribution of the base pressure of two consecutive iteration steps is not reached for the first time, the iteration is terminated and the bedding parameters of the last iteration step are output as a result in RF-SOILIN. "
"How can you determine loads at specific geo-coordinates in the online service ""Snow load zones, wind zones and earthquake zones""?","Since the input box for searching the location in the online service ""Snow load zones, wind zones and earthquake zones"" does not search the location database of the map, but instead automatically completes the entry with each new character, the numerical specification of geocoordinates in this area is not successful. On the other hand, one allows modifying the URL address in full screen mode moving the pointer to the desired geo position for load determination. For this purpose, the geo-coordinates in the format [latitude, longitude] with decimal numbers separated by dots must be specified in the last URL component after the ""="" character. "
"want to clone the virtual server, format a hard drive or swap hardware components. How can I secure the license when using a softlock dongle?","Unfortunately, it is not possible to directly secure the softlock. Before cloning, formatting or replacing the hardware, you must first transfer the license to another temporary PC. From there you can transfer the license back after cloning, formatting or hardware replacement. Under ""Downloads"" you will find the corresponding instructions. "
Why does the direction of a pattern edge line change suddenly in the support area?,"The change in direction follows from the 0% line compensation in the ""Different line-by-line compensation"" tab for the boundary line in the support area. This setting requires that the boundary line in the support area maintains the line length regardless of the set area compensation. Since the welding lines bordering on the neighboring cuts can change their lengths due to the set compensation, the algorithm looks for the geometrically unsightly solution that is in energetic balance. The sudden change is avoided if the relevant boundary lines are allowed to relax freely during the leveling process. "
Can I also use RF-SOILIN to calculate foundation bodies with different foundation heights in one model?,"Yes, that is possible. There is the option of entering additional geological regions. To do this, activate the ""Additional geological regions"" checkbox in mask 1.2. Then, in mask 1.3, information such as shape, coordinates and the number of layers of the additional geological region can be entered. In this way, different foundation heights of several floor slabs can be correctly represented in the model."
Where can I find the log files generated during import or export?,"By default, the event log files that record the actions during import or export can be found in the following folder: C:\Users\Public\Documents\Dlubal\Logs\ImportExport In most cases there are several log files in this folder. If you want to open the log of the last data exchange, it is advisable to sort the files according to the modification date. The logs themselves can be opened with the editor or WordPad, for example."
What do the nine points refer to for any profile (Z-profile) in the RF-/STEEL Warping Torsion module?,"The setting of the load application to be defined in the details refers to the main axes of the respective cross-section. With a Z profile as an example, a box with the nine edge nodes is placed around the profile. The load application is then always related to the twisted main axis angle and the associated eccentricity."
"When entering a support constraint, I get an error message that the support is not defined. What does this mean?","If a support is loaded with the load type ""node restraint"" or ""line restraint"", then this support must be supported in the direction of the displacement. Even a resilient mounting is not sufficient at this point. An error message is output."
How can I account for a column subsidence/bearing subsidence in the model?,"Forced deformation can occur at a nodal support and a line support. This has not yet been possible for surfaces. B. Settlements of a single foundation or strip foundation can be taken into account. The inputs differ as follows: Node restraintThe node restraint is to be assigned to a node supported in the direction of deformation . The forced displacement can be taken into account on the nodal support axis system in the direction uX' / uY' / uZ' and as forced rotation φX' / φY' / φZ'. Line ConstraintsEven with forced line displacements, the supports must be held in the direction of the displacement. The forced line displacement is related to the line support axis system in the direction uX' / uY' / uZ' and as a forced rotation φX'. "
Why do the results in the RF-/STAGES module not match the corresponding load cases and combinations in the RFEM or RSTAB program?,"There is no general answer to this problem. In the RF-/STAGES module, however, there is a special feature with regard to the structural system. Comparable to some other modules, eg RF-/STEEL Warping Torsion, in this module it is possible to view the static system separately from the main program. This results in some advantages with regard to the definition of construction stages, etc. However, this option means that changes in the main program RFEM or RSTAB are not automatically updated with these modules. Such an update would inevitably lead to incorrect calculations and is therefore blocked. "
have designed a steel column with the add-on module RF-/KAPPA in RSTAB version 4. I now design the steel column in version 8 in RSTAB and get more economical results. What could be the reason?,"The programs of Dlubal Software GmbH are subject to a constant improvement process, so that an improvement in the module mentioned is not improbable over a period of approx. 18 years. It should be noted, however, that a design according to DIN 18800 is no longer up-to-date and that it is better to work with the current add-on module for steel design, RF-/STEEL EC3 according to Eurocode 3."
Why do I get such high contact stresses at the foundation edges of my floor slab?,"Depending on how rigid a foundation body is, the base pressure distribution under this component also changes. In the case of slack foundation structures that are loaded by a uniform surface load, it is usually assumed that the base pressure distribution is a mirror image of the load. The plate forms a settlement trough. However, the stiffer the slab becomes, the further the base stress increases towards the edge (theoretically infinitely). Of course, the subsoil cannot absorb these theoretically infinitely large stresses. The soil would probably deviate laterally at the edge and the tension would move in from the edge."
Can I also apply user-defined loads in RX-TIMBER?,"Yes, that is possible. In the ""Loads"" input mask of the additional module, changes to the loads can be made using the ""Show generated loads or Define additional loads"" button. If you want to delete the automatically generated loads, the respective value of 0.0 must be taken into account in ""1.6 Loads"". The empty load cases can then be filled manually."
"If there are openings in surfaces, it is known that the surfaces in the opening areas are not loaded. Is it still somehow possible to generate an area load on an opening?","Yes, that is possible. The ""Generate load → From area load on openings"" function allows you to do just that. For the load, you can select in the input mask in which direction the load should act, how the surface load distribution should be, the member load direction, the type of load distribution and of course the surface load size.It is therefore possible , the loads e.g. B. for non-load-bearing elements such as windows or the like. "
"I generated beam loads from area loads using planes horizontal to the plane of a multi-story frame. In each cell there is a truss rod as a diagonal. Although the diagonal has been excluded from the loading, after separation the member load distribution on the two mullions is linear in different directions.What is the reason and what needs to be done to apply the same member load to both mullions?","As soon as the corresponding members are selected in the ""Without effect on"" field, no load is applied here.However, the load generation continues to take these members into account. In this case, it is the diagonals that are also the reason for an antimetric arrangement of the loaded cells. Accordingly, the member load profiles are linear in opposite directions. There are two options for obtaining symmetrical or constant member load profiles: Choose the ""Constant"" load distribution type for a constant progressionChoose the option ""Do not use any of the unloaded members for cell generation"" to only to get a symmetrical gradient"
Which shear force does RF-CONCRETE Surfaces use for the shear force analysis?,"The RF-CONCRETE Surfaces module uses the resulting shear force from the basic internal forces vx and vy. The internal variable vx corresponds to the transverse force curve in the direction of the local x-axis of the surface and the internal variable vy to the transverse force curve in the direction of the local y-axis. The resulting shear force, which is also used in the shear force verification, is then calculated using: vEd = √(vx² + vy²) "
The deformation calculated from the RF-CONCRETE Members module of two adjacent members differs from each other. How can that be?,"The deformation calculated with RF-CONCRETE Members represents a simplified calculation according to the standard. First, only the deformation at the point of maximum load is calculated. A factor is calculated from this value and the value of the linear deformation from RFEM or RSTAB at this point. Then the complete deformation curve from RFEM or RSTAB is multiplied by this factor and this is then output in the results of the module. The calculated factor will be around 2.66 here.It is important that the deformation can actually only be compared at the point of maximum deformation. Only there is actually a calculation. Different deformations can therefore occur with connected members."
"What does the ""Different"" effect mean when I define the impact categories?","If load cases are grouped into action categories, you can use the Action mask to specify how the load cases behave within an action category. SimultaneouslyAll load cases of the action can be combined as desired. They can appear in a combination at the same time, but they don't have to. AlternativeOf the Load cases of the action can only ever be effective (e.g. wind from different directions). DifferentDifferentiated relationships between the load cases in the action can be defined. With this option, an additional column appears in the dialog section Load cases in action. Load cases can be assigned to a group there so that they exclude each other (as with the alternative effect). The number of the group can be selected in the list."
"There are also walls or pillars in some areas of the modeled beams or ribs. Are the joists on the walls to be separated and removed, or should they run through?","Areas with double stiffness should be avoided when modeling. If a beam and a wall are modeled in the same place, these elements share the load transfer. A disadvantage of separating the bars at the wall gate is that there are singularities at this point. In addition, the area where the load is introduced from the rib into the wall is at the height of the ceiling. There is no optimal solution in this combined modeling of members and surfaces. With small models, it could Alternatively, the beams can be modeled using surfaces and the design can be carried out using result beams. "
Why are individual surface edges shown in green in the wire model display type?,"If the line supports are hidden in the project navigator - Show, these supported lines are displayed in green by default. "
For a better graphic representation it is necessary to mirror a line support. Is this possible?,The simplest procedure is to create a new line support for the respective situation. This can then z. B. also related to the local axis system and rotated if necessary.
How can I use associations to cross out individual fields in a large model as quickly as possible?,"Yes, this is entirely possible with our model generator. This can be opened via the menu bar ""Extras → Generate model - Members → Braces in cells"". If the program recognizes a closed cell, a bracing can be generated for it by assigning a member type and a cross-section."
"For a profile from the cross-section library of RSTAB/RFEM, the stresses calculated with RF-/STEEL differ from the stresses of the same profile calculated with SHAPE-THIN. What is the cause?","In RF-/STEEL, the stresses are calculated at stress points of the cross-section. The stress points stored for the cross-section can be displayed in the details of the cross-section. There are also tension points (here tension points 1 and 9) on the curves. In SHAPE-THIN, stresses can only be calculated on elements. At point elements with which Irregularities in the cross-section geometry such as fillets etc. are mapped, no stresses can be calculated. In the case of cross-sections with point elements, there may be small deviations in the stresses due to different stress points.Furthermore, SHAPE-THIN allows you to calculate the stresses for the most unfavorable element edge or only for the element calculate center lines. In RF-STEEL, the stresses are calculated exclusively at the stress points."
cannot enter rope members in my model. What can I do?,"The model type 2D -XY is probably activated. The type 2D - XY is suitable e.g. B. for flat surface structures such as slabs that are loaded perpendicular to the plane of the surface. However, the member type ""rope member"" cannot be selected for this model type.As soon as you change the model type, this member type can be selected again."
"With a defined free rectangular load, the selected projection plane of the load does not match the load direction visible in the graphic.","The projection plane and the load direction are different parameters and independent of each other.Whereas the load direction is the actual direction of the applied load, the projection plane, together with the associated coordinates, describes the load position, from from which plane the position of the load is projected onto the loaded surfaces.The graphic on the right in the ""Edit free rectangular load"" dialog window is for orientation. "
Is it possible to model a duct that is distorted from a rectangular cross-section to a pipe cross-section using RFEM? ,"Yes, that is possible. How to model such a component with quadrangle surfaces is shown step by step in the FAQ video."
"Why does the ""undo function"" only work for me for two or three processes (it is grayed out afterwards)?","When editing a model, it often happens that work steps that have just been carried out have to be undone. However, the extent to which work steps can be reset depends on the size of the buffer memory specified for this purpose. If it is a very large model with many loads and load combinations, the preset value is often not sufficient for some. In the program options, in the ""Program"" tab, you can therefore change the buffer size can be customized for the undo function. "
" I want to rigidly connect a column to the beam flange. However, in the add-on module RF-/JOINTS Steel - Rigid, the beams are always connected to the column flange. How can I realize a continuous beam?","The geometry depends on the definition of the components. In the ""1.2 Nodes and Members"" window, you specify which member is calculated as a column and which as a beam. In the standard case, the program always recognizes the support as a continuous component. To the To cycle beams, simply change the status of each staff. The actual beam gets the status ""column"" and the actual column is defined as ""beam"". "
Is it possible to have the form-finding of membrane surfaces carried out automatically with each structural change?,"By activating the RF-FORM-FINDING add-on module, a high-quality form-finding process according to the URS method is defined for each element with form-finding properties before the actual structural analysis. After the calculation, this process results in an optimal equilibrium shape that almost exactly reflects the specified form-finding parameters (prestress, sag, etc.).However, since this URS method requires an iterative calculation for display, the program for pure modeling provides an interactive graphic mode based on the force density method. This mode displays the resulting element form directly when entering the elements using the stored form-finding properties.In order to avoid any initial complications due to incompletely defined models, the mode can be activated at any time in the context menu with the ""Show form"" option - and switched off.The graphics mode takes into account all force-related form-finding inputs for bar and surface elements. A fixed boundary condition in the respective direction is assumed at all relevant nodes with a connecting element or a support definition. In addition, integrated openings in surfaces are taken into account to optimize the display of tent tips.This interactive form-finding is generally only intended for the graphic representation of the elements with applied loads and works independently of the URS form-finding, which always comes before the pure structural analysis is done. However, the networking of the surfaces is based on the currently displayed form and can thus be influenced by activating the interactive form-finding."
Which setting is to be made in the project navigator - show for the course of the internal forces/stresses?,"The FE analysis determines the results for each FE mesh node. In most cases, however, a continuous progression of the internal force or deformation should be displayed in the graphic. For this it is necessary to use the results e.g. B. to smooth by interpolation. However, the question cannot be answered universally, as this has to be decided from model to model. Basically, RFEM distinguishes between the following five options: Constant in elements Constant progression in the element Not continuous Interpolation in the element based on the results in special points Continuous within areas Averaging at the node within the defined areas with subsequent interpolation over the element Continuously total All results are averaged at the node (regardless of the defined areas) Then the interpolation takes place via the element Continuously in groups There is also the possibility of smoothing the results in groups. RFEM provides generated groups with the same material properties. User-defined groups of surfaces or solids can be created via the navigator context menu (right-click on user groups).There is already an interesting Article. "
What can I do to increase performance on a very large model?,"In order to generally optimize or minimize all processes in terms of time for larger models, various points should be considered. It can be an advantage ifthe wire model is used in the graphic instead of the filled model, the displays of the tables and the navigator are deactivated,our programs are added to the exceptions in the settings of the antivirus program,as few applications and RSTAB/RFEM files are open at the same time,the PC is upgraded . For example, a significant increase in performance can usually be achieved with SSD storage. The PC should also have sufficient RAM. In addition, generated loads can also have a negative impact on performance, since they are recalculated in the background after each work step. If there are a lot of them in the model, it can sometimes make sense to separate them. However, the enormous advantage that the loads are automatically adjusted when changes are made in the model is lost. It can also be advantageous to save the RSTAB/RFEM files locally instead of in the network. It can also be due to missing user rights if the program reacts a little sluggishly. If you are not working under an administrator account, the user must have full access rights to various directories and subdirectories. You should also ensure that you always use the current RSTAB/RFEM version to work."
"On closer inspection of the results, I noticed that the moment curves in the supports point in different directions or change signs.","When defining the columns from several individual members, you should always pay attention to the member orientation and pay attention to the rotation of the rod. Some bars have the x-axis pointing upwards or are rotated. Due to the different orientation, the sign changes for My and Mz.You can check these settings very easily by activating the display of the member axis systems."
Administrator rights are requested when importing internal forces from RSTAB or RFEM to SHAPE-THIN. Can the takeover also take place without administrator rights?,"Taking over the internal forces from RSTAB or RFEM to SHAPE-THIN is only possible with administrator rights. Unfortunately, it is not possible to only grant access to certain folders, etc., since this process interferes more deeply with the operating system. However, it is also possible in SHAPE-THIN without the Import results from RSTAB/RFEM function to import internal forces from RSTAB/RFEM. The following options are available:Paste internal forces via the clipboardThe corresponding internal forces are in RSTAB/RFEM in the table and copy it.In SHAPE-THIN, the internal forces can then be inserted via the table Insert internal forces via ExcelIn RSTAB/RFEM, the internal forces can be exported to Excel. If only individual tables are to be exported, the function can be called up via the Excel button in the table toolbar. In order to transfer several tables to Excel at once, the menu function File → Export should be used. The relevant tables can then be selected in a dialog. In Excel, the order of the table columns must then be adapted to the column arrangement in SHAPE-THIN.In SHAPE-THIN, the ""Export/Import of the table"" function can be used via the Excel button in the table toolbar ""3.1 Internal forces"".In the dialog the option ""Import table"" and the setting ""Import table from the active workbook"" must be selected. Before importing, the Excel workbook must be opened. If the ""Import table from active worksheet"" check box is not set, the worksheet with the name ""LF[LFNr.] - 3.1 internal forces"" will be imported. "
Can I display negative shear stresses in SHAPE-THIN?,"In the graphic, only absolute values are given for the shear stresses. In the results table of SHAPE-THIN, however, there is also the possibility of reading the values of the individual components. The values are displayed there with the correct sign."
How can I enter a curved beam in RSTAB?,"In RSTAB, you can create an arc-shaped beam using various arc generators. The corresponding function can be found in the ""Extras"" → ""Generate model"" → ""Arc"" menu."
Why are the added commands in the toolbars sometimes lost after an update?,"When creating custom toolbars, care should always be taken not to drag commands onto the standard toolbars and menus. These predefined toolbars are always overwritten during installation for update reasons. Your own toolbars and menus are compatible and remain after an update.In the ""Configuration Manager"" dialog, you can use the ""Export configuration as a file"" function to export the entire setting, including all other things (colors, options, borders, etc .) are saved."
"Why doesn't the online service ""Snow load zones, wind zones and earthquake zones"" give a load for each country?","The online service ""Snow load zones, wind zones and earthquake zones"" graphically displays the building loads according to the relevant standards on the Google Maps map and outputs the site-specific building loads for an explicit point on the map. Due to the national reference of the standards used, the online service provides information for each type of load described in the standard. If the standard does not specify a specific type of load, the online service does not provide any further information for this type of load either (e.g. snow loads in the African desert). If a If a certain building load standard is not offered in the selection boxes of the online service, this standard has not yet been incorporated. Our team strives to expand the online service for all relevant countries around the world and to maintain the inventory. The implementation priorities are based on the needs of the users and the mandatory maintenance and renewal work. "
Why can't I define an eccentricity in the Z-direction in my 2D model?,"Eccentricity cannot be defined in a 2D model XY with degrees of freedom (uz/fx/fy). An eccentricity usually also results in a normal force that is not covered by these degrees of freedom.Caution is also required when using ribs. In contrast to the 3D model, the effective width also changes the stiffness of the system.It is therefore usually better to calculate beam models in a 3D model."
Can I also create auxiliary lines in a user-defined coordinate system?,"The input of auxiliary lines in the user-defined coordinate system is currently not possible and in most cases not necessary. If you take a roof plane as an example, it is only necessary to enter the auxiliary lines in relation to the working planes. In the attached video I used the function ""Auxiliary lines → Inclined with 2 points"". "
"When importing a dxf file, I get the message that the dimensions of the model are greater than 10000 meters. What should I do?","The message is intended to indicate that the dimensions of the model are very large. This can have the following causes: 1) The dimensions of the model are actually very large, so that no further measures are necessary. 2) The wrong length units were set during import. In this case, the length units must be checked in the ""ASCII format DXF (*.dxf)"" tab of the ""Import"" window and the desired length unit must be set. 3) The model is far from the origin. The model can be moved to the origin in the CAD program and then imported into RSTAB/RFEM. "
"How can I according to DIN EN 1992-1-1/NA: Chapter NCI to 2.3.1.2 (3) or DIN EN 1990/NA Chapter NDP to A.1.3.1(4) the partial safety factor γ Consider Q,T in the automatic load combinatorics with 1.0? By default, the value γQ,T= 1.5 is used.","In order to implement this in the program, the ""Temperature"" load case must be copied. All loads in the load case are also copied. One load case is used for the load combinations in the ultimate limit state (ULS), the other for the serviceability limit state (SLS). The load in the load case for ULS is now multiplied by 1.0/1.5=0.667. So that the two load cases do not occur simultaneously, but only for the specific design situation, exceptions are determined in the respective combination rules. For ULS, the self-weight load case can be easily defined in such a way that it is not combined with the temperature load case for SLS. Exactly the other way around for SLS, i.e. load case self-weight not with temperature for ULS. The ""Different for each combination rule"" check must be activated.Then you get the desired load combination."
Can I display the results of my model in several windows within an instance of RSTAB / RFEM? Can I print several graphics on one page at the same time?,"Yes, it works. All you have to do is click on ""Window"" in the menu bar. Various arrangements can be selected. With this variant, for example, different results of the model can be clearly displayed in several smaller windows. Several windows can also be printed in the printout report as in the screen view. This allows several views to be displayed in a space-saving manner."
"In RF-/DYNAM Pro I get error message no. 10040: ""It was not possible to calculate the eigenvalues for the entered accuracy. [...]"". How can I fix this?","In a dynamic analysis, only as many mode shapes can be calculated as the system has degrees of freedom. Degrees of freedom means the number of mass points multiplied by the number of directions in which the masses act.ExampleA cantilever, which passes through the FE mesh is not divided, has a mass point at the end. The effective direction of the masses is limited to the X and Y directions in RF-/DYNAM Pro. The system therefore has 2 degrees of freedom, so only 2 eigenmodes can be calculated.Caution: In this case, the choice of the solution method is of great importance. In contrast to the ""square root of the characteristic polynomial"" method, the Lanczos method cannot calculate all the eigenvalues of the system, but only n -1, i.e. only 1 eigenvalue in this example. "
Can I see the results of each load step after the calculation?,"Access to the results of the individual load levels is possible by activating the ""Save results of load increases"" function in the calculation parameters of the load case or load combination. You can also use the ""Calculation diagrams"" mask in the calculation parameters to evaluate individual results for selected elements. It is also easy to create multiple calculation diagrams."
I get error 30420 that the tolerance (epsilon) for integrating the nodes into the lines is too large. What can I do?,"The tolerance epsilon can be found in the FE mesh settings in the ""Basic"" pane. It controls how the FE mesh generator should behave when nodes are very close to lines. If the tolerance is greater than the distance from the node to the line, this small local difference is neglected in the mesh generation. In the case shown, the network of the line is deflected towards the node. In this case, the line is no longer ideally straight. If the tolerance is smaller than the distance, a separate FE node is created for the node. The error message appears if the distance between two adjacent nodes is less than epsilon, and these are connected with a line. In most cases, this is due to an inaccuracy in the modeling. Since the error message does not contain any information on node numbers, you can use the ""Identical nodes"" model control to help. This searches for nodes whose distance falls below a tolerance delta. The value of the tolerance is now set to the value of epsilon. The nodes are then listed in the upper part of the dialog. How to proceed varies depending on the case. If there is an inaccuracy in the modeling, it can be adjusted. In other cases, you can of course further reduce the tolerance of epsilon. "
"When calculating a connection with the additional module RAHMECK Pro, a message appears that the value is outside the permissible range (previous value: 160, min. value 200). What does the mentioned note mean?","It is usually the case that the dimensions of the bars do not match. In the example model, the ledger has a flange width of 200 mm and the support of 160 mm. This connection is not permitted in the additional module because the flange width of the support should be at least as large as the flange width of the component to be connected. As soon as the cross-sections are defined according to this rule, the dimensioning of the connection also works."
Is it sufficient to carry out the calculation with surface elements or should it be better to use volume elements?,"If components are calculated using the finite element method (FEM), you can choose between surfaces and solids in RFEM. The great advantage of surfaces lies in the calculation time, since the FE elements are only defined in the surface plane. The third dimension, i.e. the thickness, is taken into account as a physical property in the calculation. Thus, a surface can be viewed as a mathematical simplification. In addition, surfaces can also be meshed more easily than solids (Jacobi Matrix). The plate elements are divided into two element types. While in the classical theory of thin plates (Kirchhoff) the shear deformations due to the shear forces are neglected, in the theory of thick plates (Reissner-Mindlin) special extended approaches have to be adopted. In the case of thin plates, the pure bending load-bearing effect dominates. Therefore, the simplified bending theory is also sufficient. With increasing thickness, the proportion of lateral shear influence on the load-bearing effect increases. Above a certain thickness, the error if this proportion is neglected is so great that the higher theory of the thick plate becomes absolutely necessary. When a slab is to be regarded as ""thin"" or ""thick"" does not depend on the ""dimension to thickness"" ratio of the individual finite element, but on the conditions in the static system. In addition to the plate thickness, influencing factors here include the spans (length, width, radius), the type of support and the type of load and their distribution. A binding value cannot be specified due to the large number of influences. A guideline which describes the validity of the relevant elements. The size ""d"" is the thickness of the component and ""L"" is the length of the component or the distance between the bearings. The ratio d/L gives an indication of when an element is valid for an analysis. When d/L is large, shear deformation is a critical quantity and the user should prefer to use solids. If d/L is small, the shear deformation does not have a decisive influence and surface elements are the most effective choice. Calculations were carried out with the different elements. The top view is shown so that the deformations can be interpreted in the image plane. For a small d/L ratio of 0.2, the deformations for all three variants match very well. At d/L = 0.4, there are already differences between the calculation of the thin and thick plate. In the extreme case d/L = 0.7, a difference between the thick plate and the volume can also be observed. The loads have been chosen to achieve the same deformation for all solids to produce a meaningful expression. "
Can I also create load combinations manually in RSTAB 8 or RFEM 5?,"If you want to create the load combinations or result combinations manually, you must first specify this in the basic data of the model. By deactivating the ""Create combinations automatically"" button, all load combinations must be created manually. Using the ""Edit load cases and combinations"" dialog, all load combinations including the partial safety factors can then be superimposed. In the ""Result combinations"" tab, you can then create a result envelope from these load combinations, for example."
"During the calculation, I get a warning that some elements are connected to the buckling panel but are not defined like stiffeners. What should I do?","In the cross-section shown, elements no. 8 and 9 are defined as buckling stiffeners and connected to the buckling panel with the zero element no. 5 or 6 (thickness t = 0 mm).Bulking stiffeners must be connected to the buckling field with ""normal"" elements (thickness t > 0 mm). Here, for example, the zero elements no. 5 and 6 can be deleted and the element no. 8 and 9 can be connected directly to the buckling panel. "
Can I save the load combinations and result combinations and read them in again in other positions?,"Yes this is possible with a combination scheme. This can be used to create user-defined templates.The Combination Scheme dialog can be called up via the ""Extras"" menu. A scheme defined there can serve as a template for your load data. You can create a combination scheme in any model and also call it up from any model.In a combination scheme, you specify the load cases, load and result combinations to be created with the relevant key data and basic settings. In addition to the number of LFs, LKs and EKs, you also define the factors and overlay type in a combination scheme. When creating a new model, you can then quickly access these specifications , so that you only have to enter the contents of the load cases (member loads, etc.). If you have already created several schemes, you can select one of them from the pull-down list. Use the [New scheme] button to create another combination scheme. You can adopt the existing load cases and combinations of the current model. The [Create load cases, load combinations and result combinations defined in tables] button transfers the current combination scheme to the Model. The combination schemes can also be exported to Excel and imported again. The user-defined Combination schemes are stored in the file KombinSchema.dat, which is located by default in the master data folder ""C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\Global\Stammdat"" (old) or ""C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\Global\General Data"" (new). If you copy this file to another computer, you can also use the combination schemes there."
"Why do I get error message 226 in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces? The crack width is not verified or the utilization is at ""0.00"".","Message no. 226 appears in the results dialogs 3.1 to 3.3 in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces if the concrete tensile stresses from the defined load are smaller than the concrete tensile strength for the surface to be designed. In In this case, message 226 is displayed with a corresponding note. By clicking on the [i] button, you can open the design details for the respective non-designable point and display the intermediate values for determining the applied tensile stress. "
"During the installation, I get a message from the Sentinel HASP Run-time installer.What do I do? ","The reason for this is that a service of the dongle driver is still in use and therefore cannot be terminated by the installation. In this case, the corresponding service, e.g. hasplms.exe or hasplmv.exe, should be included in the services of the operating system to be terminated manually. The installation should then run smoothly. "
How to use the dlubal parameters in Revit interface?,"The Dlubal parameters are parameters in Revit which do not exist by default. They are only released after activation (""Add parameters"" -> ""Start"") in the various dialogs. This is RSTAB/RFEM-specific information that can be stored in Revit. When exporting from Revit to Dlubal, this information can be read out and converted by RSTAB/RFEM. ""Draught-free"" - can be found in the analytical wall properties - corresponds to the surface type stiffness ""membrane free"" ""Surface support"" - to be found in the analytical slab or slab properties - creates a surface support with specified spring constants in RFEM ""Dlubal name (material)"" - found in the custom material parameters - direct assignment of the Dlubal material name possible (without conversion table) ""Dlubal name (cross section)"" - found in the type properties of columns or beams - direct assignment of the Dlubal cross-section name possible (without conversion table) ""Member type truss/tension member"" - found in the analytical beam or column properties - corresponds to the member type Truss member or tension member in RSTAB/RFEM"
"In the fatigue check, I get very little or no utilization of my members.What can be the reason?","The RF-/STEEL Fatigue Members module requires a stress cycle or a stress range for the fatigue analysis. In order to be able to determine this, the input of the load cases to be designed must be checked. If, for example, only the load cases with the actual service load were entered for the design and the self-weight of the structure (here e.g. LC1) was not selected, it can be this effect. If the load case ""Self weight"" becomes the If the calculation of the tension play is used, this may result in a significantly higher utilization. In this context, reference should also be made to any result combinations selected for the design. These should also be created in such a way that the relevant game of tension can be determined in the module. "
Why are the results in RFEM/RSTAB sometimes deleted when I export the data to Revit?,"The interface between Dlubal and Revit works internally with so-called Global Unique Identifiers (GUIDs). In Revit, each object is assigned a GUID. During import and export, this GUID is transferred via the interface and added to the associated Dlubal object (member, surface, etc.). By assigning GUIDs, updates are possible in both directions, with only those objects that are affected by changes having to be updated. Other objects remain unaffected. This ensures better compatibility when exchanging data. The comparison requires that each object in Revit has a corresponding counterpart in the Dlubal application. In Revit, for example, each line support is treated individually. If a line support type is assigned to several lines in RFEM, then duplicates of the line support type are automatically created in RFEM when exporting to Revit. A line is assigned to each duplicate. After that, a 1:1 comparison is possible. Due to the functionality of the interface described with the associated change in the Dlubal model data, it cannot be ruled out that the results will be deleted. It is therefore advisable to export the model to Revit prior to calculation. The results can be displayed in a be transferred later to the second export process."
carry out a stability analysis according to the second-order theory. Why is the partial safety factor γM1 used here for a stress analysis?,"The Eurocode provides various partial safety factors for cross-section and stability verifications. A special feature must be observed when stability analyzes are carried out using the second-order theory and the approach of imperfections as cross-section analyzes. In this case, the resistances are to be reduced with γM1."
How can I specify different bedding numbers for a large floor slab?,The definition of the surface supports (bedding) is a property of the surface in RFEM. This means that you have to subdivide the entire floor slab into several partial areas - corresponding to the areas with different bedding numbers.
"How can I enter/find the following cross-section ""I-PAR 700/135/6.6/10.2/15"" in the cross-section library?","This cross-section is a parameterized I-profile. This can be entered in the cross-section library. In addition to the Parametric - thin-walled cross-sections, for which information on the weld seam is usually required, the parameterized cross-sections are based on the rolled cross-sections. For some of the rolled cross-sections there is a Parameterization possible. This allows you to set parameters for the fillet radius, the flange thickness and the web thickness, for example. So that the graphical interface of the cross-section parameters does not have to be opened when changes are made, it is also possible to adjust the cross-section dimensions directly via the text field of the cross-section. If there is a change, the cross-section is updated immediately in the background."
Can a foundation also be reinforced with pure steel bars? ,"Yes, this is possible. Switch to the ""1.3 Materials"" input dialog. There you can deselect the ""Available welded wire meshes"" and select the reinforcing bars that should be considered for the reinforcement of the foundation. Alternatively, you can also specify an alternative reinforcement proposal for the foundation plate in dialogs 2.4 or 2.5 after a calculation has already been carried out, in which e.g. After the reinforcement proposal was changed in dialogs 2.4 and 2.5, the result must be recalculated. If you switch to another dialog after making a change to the reinforcement, a message is displayed regarding the need to recalculate the results. "
have several printout reports and want to add another one. Is it possible to move the new printout report between two existing ones?,"No, that doesn't work yet. However, it is very easy to use the printout report manager. This can be used to copy and delete existing printout reports. New printout reports can also be created by entering any printout report number. "
How is shrinkage taken into account in the calculation with RF-CONCRETE Deflect?,"In the analytical deformation calculation with RF-CONCRETE Deflect, the shrinkage of the concrete is taken into account via an additional curvature. It should also be noted here that an asymmetrical reinforcement arrangement on the top and bottom of the surface leads to an additional curvature, since a larger reinforcement cross-section on one of the two sides would impede the shrinkage more than on the opposite side. This leads to an additional warping of the surface. Depending on the system, this effect can mean that, despite increased reinforcement, the calculation does not result in a reduction in deformation. More information on this can also be found in the RF-CONCRETE Surfaces manual in section 2.7.5.2."
How can self-weight and other additional loads be taken into account in the form-finding process?,"The form-finding process in RFEM searches for a form that is in equilibrium with the edge reactions for members depending on the defined force or geometry parameters and for surfaces depending on the defined force parameters. Step next to these element-related form-finding specifications still have other force influences such as e.g. B. the dead weight of the elements themselves or the weight of the rope knot connections, these loads are to be defined in an additional load case with the action category ""Form-finding"". The The form-finding process recognizes these special load cases based on the action category and, in addition to the element-related form-finding information, also includes all loads from all load cases with the action category ""Form-finding"" for the form search in the analysis. Since the loads in the load cases with the ""Form-finding"" action category are impressed into the model with the form-finding process, a separate analysis of these load cases is unimportant. These load cases are only used as input for the form-finding process. "
How to adjust the appearance of the objects in the background (hidden in the background)?,The display or intensity of the inactive objects can be set under Options → Program Options → Graphics
"Can I also use the load generator ""From area load on members using plane"" on members that are not in one plane?","The load generator ""Convert area loads into member loads from plane"" is basically only intended for members in one plane and works best that way. In the case of structures in which the members do not lie in one plane, but individual areas do, the ""From area load on members using cells"" function may be a better choice: With this, closed cells can also be generated from three members using zero members, which then can be loaded.Otherwise the tolerance settings would be a possible solution. They also make it possible to capture members outside of a plane. You can define the details. You can find more information about the load generators in Chapter 11.8.2 of the manual."
Why are no concrete stresses displayed in the add-on module RF-CONCRETE Surfaces?,"If you want to have the concrete stress or the corresponding proof output, then the corresponding point in the ""Settings for the analytical method of serviceability"" must be selected. If the concrete stress is calculated, you will get another item ""Concrete stress"" in the results navigator. In the intermediate results of the concrete stress, you can display the stresses both in ZstI and in ZstII."
"When I call up the Windows calculator in the Dlubal programs, an error message appears. The calculator then starts, but you cannot accept the results directly. Why is that?","Unfortunately, the calculator implemented in Windows 10 is not compatible with our programs. For example, you can use the ""Copy"" option to paste the values to the clipboard and then paste them back into the program to still use the calculator. A better alternative is to replace the Windows 10 calculator with the one from Windows 7 or Windows 8. There are enough instructions on the internet on how to do this. You just have to make sure that the calc.exe file in the Windows directory C:\Windows\System32 actually starts the old calculator. The Windows 7 calculator can then be used again as usual, with the results being accepted."
"What is the effect of the stiffness type ""free of membrane tension"" in the surface properties?","The stiffness type ""free of membrane tension"" describes the plate and disk stiffness of surfaces. Here, the plate stiffness including the shear stiffness perpendicular to the surface plane is linearly elastic and the disk stiffness in the surface plane is nonlinearly elastic with the material model according to ""Drucker-Prager"" depending on the defined thickness and the assigned material. So that the surface behaves ""tension-free"" in the direction of the pane, the non-linear material model reacts to elements under tension with an almost zero yield stress fy,t in connection with a relatively small hardening modulus Ep. For compressive forces, on the other hand, due to a relatively high compressive yield stress fy,c, the elements remain linearly elastic and react with an unhindered transmission of compressive force. Since the stiffness type ""free of membrane tension"" basically modifies the disk degrees of freedom of surfaces, this type is only used for surfaces in the relevant 3D model types , 2D - XZ (uX/uZ/φY) and 2D - XY (uX/ uY/φZ). For a better description of the partial non-linearity of this surface stiffness type was added in the version RFEM 5.06.1103 on February 4th, 2016 the type was renamed from ""draught-free"" to ""diaphragm free"". The Knowledge Base article ""Modeling approaches for shear bearing connections using FEM"" shows a possible application. "
How can I mount a bar on a console with screw connections?,"The combination of a bar bedding with nodal supports, which can each fail under pressure, is best suited here. The results show that the bar bedding absorbs the compressive forces and the nodal supports absorb the tensile forces."
How can wall and ceiling slabs be represented in a rod model?,"With the ""node coupling"" function, it is possible to ideally connect nodes to one another.There are two possible coupling types to choose from. With one coupling type ""Plane"" the displacements in the coupling plane and the rotations perpendicular to the plane are coupled. For example, stiffening panes can be modeled. The ""Coupling for equal degrees of freedom"" coupling type allows the coupled displacements and rotations between the nodes to be defined individually. The node coupling function has already been shown on an info day. You can find them at the end of the attached video."
Why aren't the same maximum internal forces determined in RF-/STEEL when calculating a result combination as in the results in the result combination itself?,"This behavior is caused by the detailed settings in the RF-/STEEL module. The results of result combinations can be used in many different ways. In order to use the same maximum internal forces for the stress analysis. However, this setting is very conservative, since not all maximum internal forces can occur at the same time. "
Is it also possible to open RX-TIMBER files in RSTAB and RFEM?,"To open an RX-TIMBER file in RFEM or RSTAB, the ""All files (*.*)"" option must be selected as ""File type"". The geometry data, loads and load combinations are adopted. Design-relevant settings such as shear force reduction, fire protection definitions, serviceability parameters, etc. are not adopted and must be redefined in RF-/TIMBER Pro. If the model does not appear in the work window, please leave the view with the Display the option ""Show model as a whole""."
Red values are displayed in the intermediate results of RF-SOILIN. What's it all about?,"As soon as the result values are displayed in red, this is essentially an error message.The defined depth z is then not sufficient. The standard stipulates that calculations must be carried out down to the depth at which sigma_Z is <= 0.2*sigma_ü. In the graphic, 0.2*sigma_ü is shown as a gray line, sigma_Z as a red line. The layer structure should be defined so deeply that both lines intersect. The two lines do not intersect, so the values are displayed in red and a sufficient depth must be defined."
How can I change the language in the RX-TIMBER add-on module?,"Contrary to RSTAB and RFEM, the language setting of the add-on module RX-TIMBER can be found in the project manager of the program. The corresponding setting can be found in the menu bar under ""Edit""."
Our data is managed on a cloud server. Can I run a network dongle on this virtual server?,"Yes, this is possible. In addition to the conventional hardlock dongle (USB dongle), a so-called softlock dongle can also be used. A virtual fingerprint is created for identification and the license is thus bound to the computer or to the virtual machine. The features described in the link (below) must be taken into account."
How can I generate a clamp or a spring for the bearing in RX-TIMBER BSH?,"In RX-Holz BSH you only have the option of defining a restraint using the ""Column"" function in addition to the predefined ""fixed"" and ""free"" supports. Spring stiffnesses are calculated analytically using the relationships between height, cross-section and the definition of ""hinged"" to ""clamped"" and displayed in the window at the bottom right. These are then used for the calculation. So if you want to connect the beam to the column in a rigid manner, you can use this function."
Can individual hollow profiles also be verified with the additional module HOHLPROF?,"The 1993-1-8 standard specifies what type of cross-sections can be considered. The verifications are designed in such a way that only one wall thickness is possible per cross-section. If an impermissible cross-section is detected, a corresponding message is displayed. Therefore, the question of the extension for such cross-sections must be answered in the negative. The standard is largely based on trials/research. Therefore, the focus is on hot-finished hollow sections according to EN 10210 and cold-finished hollow sections according to EN 10219."
"Can I also convert a generated load into a ""real"" member load?","Yes, that is possible. To do this, right-click on the generated load and select the ""Disconnect generated load"" function from the context menu. The generated loads are converted into normal member loads and can be changed as required."
"When opening a model with the viewer, I get a message that the FE mesh must be deleted. The results are then also deleted. what to do here",The same version of the viewer that was used to view the file should always be used to view the file.In the project manager there is the option of checking the properties of the file. The version number is also stored there.The relevant program version can be downloaded from the following link:https://www.dlubal.com/de/support-und-schulungen/service/older-program-versions
How do I get the model displayed without a color scale in the printout?,"There are two ways to do this. If you print a graphic in the printout report, you can select where the position of the color scale should be in the ""Color scale"" tab. The size of the color scale can also be adjusted in the same dialog. If the ""No color scale"" checkbox is deactivated, it will be hidden in the graphic in the printout report. The color scale can also be hidden afterwards, even though the image is already in the printout report. To do this, right-click on the image. The properties must then be selected in the context menu in order to access the ""Color scale"" tab. The position and size of the color scale can also be edited there. "
"No resultant is displayed for a section in a selected section, what can I do?","So that the resultant of the section can also be displayed in a selection, the section itself must be visible in the selected view. So when creating your partial view, also select the section to be displayed accordingly. "
Why are my guides so long? Can I shorten this a bit?,"By default, the length of guides corresponds to the total length of the displayed area of the grid. However, this length can also be conveniently adjusted in the program using the ""Work plane and grid/snap"" function. In addition, the grid can also be automatically adjusted to the model size in a very convenient way. The lengths of the auxiliary lines also change accordingly."
How do you create a blind hole in a volume?,"In RFEM, you can use a volume intersection to create a blind hole in a solid. Two valid solids must exist for the conversion. One solid should represent the part to be drilled and the other solid should represent a simplified drill bit. The simplified drill volume should consist of a cylindrical shank with an attached cone tip. The diameter of the shank is to be modeled with the blind hole diameter and the length of the shank is longer than the blind hole depth. For the intersection, the drilling volume is related to the to place the volume to be drilled on the position of the planned blind hole. Here it is important that the drilling volume protrudes slightly over the base volume. Then both volumes are to be marked and the volume option ""New composite volume"" selected in the context menu. By specifying which volume B (volume to be drilled) to subtract from which volume A (volume to be drilled) and enabling the ""Solid B as cavity"" option, the program disables the two initial volumes and creates a new composite volume. This volume represents the volume with the blind hole and intelligently depends on the geometric specifications of the two initial volumes. "
Can I transfer sections from one model to another?Or do I have to redefine the sections?,"Yes, it is possible to transfer the sections from one model to another.You can select the sections in the original model and then transfer them with [Ctrl+C] and [Ctrl+V]. "
"Can a contact solid or layered FE mesh be used for a solid even with curved surfaces? Namely, I get error number 848.","Yes, the contact solid or a layered FE mesh also works with curved surfaces. However, the following restrictions apply: The surface is only simply curvedThe curved surfaces must be modeled using concentric circles. The easiest way to create the lines is to use the ""Shift line parallel"" function"
How can I increment a load?,"The ""incrementally increasing load"" function of load cases and load combinations can gradually increase the assigned load level and seek a balance for each load level. The reference level ""Load level 1.0 = 100% of the defined load"" is the defined load for load cases and the load case compilation modified with partial safety factors for load combinations. The detailed settings of the function define the Initial load level k0, the amount of the incremental load increase Δk, the refinement of the last load level, the termination criterion and the static initial load situation. The start of the process is defined by defining the initial load level k0. This input is independent of the pure load case and load combination input and can be greater or less than 1.0. The program always outputs all results based on the load level 1.0 as part of the regular calculation and also analyzes the possible load levels by activating the ""Gradually increasing load"". The load increase Δk is the increment for the gradually increasing load. With each process loop, the program increases the load to be analyzed by adding the increment to the previously analyzed load level. The increment is constant until the termination criterion is reached. Due to the constant size of the increment, no exact load factor can be determined for the termination criterion. At the end, the program shows the approximate load factor based on the last load level at which an equilibrium can still be found for the model. After calculation, the load factor is output in the table ""4.0 Results - Summary"" under the respective load situation. If a refinement of the last load increase is specified, the initial increment Δk is divided by the refinement value after the abort criterion has been reached and the process is carried out again from the last functioning load level until it is aborted again. The smaller increment results in a more accurate load factor. The termination criterion for the process is basically the point at which the program no longer balances the applied load finds (second order theory). In addition, the termination can be specified by activating a maximum deformation at a certain node. Since in reality certain force components remain constant regardless of the action (e.g. E.g. self-weight, prestress, etc.), the detail setting offers an option to apply a fixed load component for the gradually increasing load. The fixed load can be either a load case or a load combination. This load component is independent of the load to be increased and is simply added to the variable component in the process. In addition to the final load factor, these are also the intermediate results of the valid load levels Interestingly, the intermediate results can be made visible with the load case and load combination function ""Save results of load increases"". There are corresponding options for the display in the panel window and the result tables. In RSTAB, the activation for saving the intermediate results with the add-on module RSBUCK and in RFEM the activation of the gradually increasing load with the additional module RF-STABLE coupled. In these cases, in addition to licensing the main program, a license for the corresponding additional module must also be provided. "
Which degrees of freedom are considered for the eigenvalue solver to determine the ideal bifurcation moment for lateral-torsional buckling (Mcr) in the RF-/STEEL EC3 module?,"For the design with the equivalent member method and the general method, four degrees of freedom are taken into account in the eigenvalue solver. These are: uY' (displacement out of plane)φX' (twist around the X' axis)φZ' (twist around the Z' axis)ω (warping) When activating the RF-/STEEL warping torsion module extension, seven degrees of freedom are available: ux (Shift in x)uy (Shift in y)uz (Shift in z)φx (rotation around the x-axis)φy (rotation around the y-axis)φz (rotation around the z-axis)ω (warping) "
Why are new bars generated in my model when I cross one bar with another?," As soon as the ""Auto connect bars"" function is activated, a bar that is touched with the start or end node of another bar is split. If this function is not activated, this means for the RSTAB model that the members are not connected to each other. Members such as e.g. B. the wind braces of a hall that cross each other are not divided by this function. The function can be called up by calling the context menu in the RSTAB or RFEM model activate."
In RF-PUNCH Pro I get the message no. 58 according to which the surface load within the critical perimeter for the result combinations cannot be determined. Where does this message come from? And how can I bypass this?,"As soon as the punching shear load is to be determined in RF-PUNCH Pro from the shear forces in the critical perimeter, the option ""Consider surface load within the critical perimeter"" is available at the bottom of the input dialog 1.5. If you select the ""Detect"" option, the program needs a clear load situation. This unambiguous load situation does not exist when applying the result combination (EK). Therefore you get the mentioned message no. 58. You can work around the problem by specifying the area load within the critical perimeter either manually or instead with the result combinations ( EK's) with the load combinations (LK's). "
How does the license distribution work for a network dongle for the RF-MAT NL add-on module?,"As soon as you create a material to which a nonlinear material model is assigned, the license for RF-MAT NL is used. The license is not released until you close the file or change the material model. The license is therefore occupied for the entire duration, even if no calculation takes place."
"In RF-PUNCH Pro, is it also possible to apply the surface load within the critical perimeter?","Yes, from program version RFEM 5.20.01 it is possible to consider the load on the surface within the critical perimeter. As soon as you e.g. B. to determine the punching load in the critical perimeter at a wall corner or a wall end, you have the additional option at the end of the input dialog 1.5. You can also choose whether the surface load should be determined automatically or specified. The area load or additional load considered by the program is documented in a table in the results dialog 2.1. "
Can I just copy a model to another?,"Yes, that is possible. If the model or individual objects are selected, they can be copied using ctrl + c and pasted into another model using ctrl + v. However, it should be noted that loads can only be accepted to a limited extent. Exporting using the block manager is much more convenient. This can also be used to transfer the load cases and loads. More information about the block manager can be found at the link below."
"When calculating a rope with the additional module STEEL EC3, I get the error message ""Inadmissible characteristic stress for material no. 1! Please correct in table 1.2.""","For the material ""rope..."", no information on the yield strength and tensile strength is stored in the database. Therefore, the additional module for these members lacks the calculation basis. In order to still be able to prove such materials,you would have to create your own material and, if the information from the manufacturer is known, add the missing parameters manually."
Why isn't my linearly variable area load displayed as a triangle even though I specified the minimum load value as zero? ,"The loads are always displayed with relative limit settings.This ensures that loads on very small structures but also on very large structures can still be displayed in a meaningful way. The relative limit settings can be customized through the display properties. In the attached video, lowering the minimum relative limit for displaying the load size allows for the user-desired shape of the graph."
Why does the RF-STABILITY add-on module not consider any stiffness modifications when determining the load distribution factors? ,"The defined stiffness modifications are only taken into account in the RF-STABILITY stability analysis if the ""Activate stiffness changes from RFEM"" option is activated in the ""1.1 General data"" menu under the ""Options"" field. "
Do I use the load cases or the load or result combinations for the verification in the additional modules? Does the respective module (e.g. RF-/FOUNDATION Pro) automatically create the required load combinations?,"Basically, you should select the design load in for the design situation to be examined for the design. For example, ""ULS"" or ""SLS"". It is important that the add-on modules in RFEM or RSTAB do not generate these design load cases automatically. In other words, it is not enough to just select the load cases in the additional modules. In the run-up to the design, you must either create or generate load combinations or result combinations in the additional modules. These load or result combinations can then be used for the design in the additional modules . If you want to carry out the verification in an additional module explicitly for a specific load case, then you can of course select this for the design. If several individual load cases are selected for the design, the verification is carried out one after the other for each load case."
"What is the significance of the function ""Only consider increasing loads"" in the wind load generator?","If the consideration of the internal pressure is activated in the wind load generator, the wind pressure on the inner surface of the structure is added to the wind pressure on the outer surface of the structure. If the internal pressure has a relieving effect when determining the reaction variable (we + wi), this should generally be set to zero. This can be implemented in the load generator with the function ""Only consider increasing loads""."
"Despite the reduction in crane load cases to a minimum, there seem to be possible combinations that are above the termination limit (1,000,000). Is there a way to influence this value?",tst
How do I combine the effect of wind load on a guyed mast from mean wind load and additional field load (patch load) according to standard EN 1993-3-1 B.4.3.2.5 (1)?,"The standard EN 1993-3-1 describes in chapter B.4.3 a dummy load method to consider the dynamic response to the turbulence of the natural wind. [1] To determine the effect of the wind load STM, the internal forces Sm from the average wind load are added to the structural response Sp together depending on the bay-wise additional loads. The field-wise additional loads describe the fluctuating components of the wind and are also called patch loads. ${\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{TM}}={\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{m}\; }\pm{\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{p}}$ [2] Because of the non-linear load-bearing behavior, the patch loads are together with the mean wind load in the patch load cases Si analyze. The selected field with the increased patch load and the remaining area with the average wind load are to be analyzed here. In order to determine the pure fluctuation components of the increased spanwise additional load to the average wind load, the average wind load Sm must be subtracted from the patch load cases Si. The building response Sp then results from the root mean square of the difference mentioned. ${\mathrm S}_ {\mathrm p}=\sqrt{\sum _{\mathrm i=1}^{\mathrm N}\left({\mathrm S}_{\mathrm i}-{\mathrm S}_{\mathrm m} \right)^2}$ withi ... number of fields consideredN ... total number of required load cases (fields i considered)Sm ... internal forces due to the mean wind load Si ... internal forces due to the i-th load case (mean wind load with partial increased patch loads) In RFEM, the superimposition of these two quantities SM and Sp depending on the wind direction in STM via an interaction of load cases and result combinations. It is assumed that the mean wind load Sm and the patch load cases Si (mean wind load Sm with partially increased patch loads) in separate load cases are available. From these load cases, the differences from Si - Sm must first be formed using result combinations. The quadratic mean value Sp (with positive and negative part) can then be formed from these difference combinations via a further enveloping result combination by activating the SRSS option. Finally, in a final combination of results, the load STM is determined by adding the mean wind load Sm to the square mean value Sp. "
Can you use RFEM to investigate the effects of an airtight sealed object?,"In order to examine a gas-tight object, it must first be modeled closed in RFEM. A new solid can then be created from the boundary surfaces. ""Gas"" must be set as the solid type for this and it must have a material of the same name. Additional gas parameters can be defined in the ""Gas"" tab. As a result, the resulting gas pressure, the overpressure and the initial pressure can be output graphically for the gas volume. Furthermore, the result navigator provides the deformed volume of the gas and its temperature. "
"After downloading to the current version, the interface of the screen display changes. On first launch, the toolbar command buttons were not in the correct place as usual.","It is easiest to use the ""View → Arrange toolbar automatically"" function for this behavior. It sorts them again according to the default settings. The next time you start the program, this behavior should not occur again. Please check whether you have sufficient user rights . Otherwise it can also happen that the individual view settings are reset after a restart. "
How can I deactivate or modify individual nodal supports in the model for each load case?,"In RSTAB 8 and RFEM 5 there is the possibility to assign individual objects such as B. nodal supports to assign different stiffnesses for each load case. You can find this function in the calculation parameters of the load cases and load combinations. In RFEM 5, individual objects can also be deactivated for each load case.The tab makes it possible to ignore certain objects of the model during the calculation. This can be used, for example, to examine the effect of temporary members (assembly supports) or bearings.In order for the adjustments to be taken into account during the calculation, the function Modify stiffness Enabled. "
"Can I display a filigree slab or a precast slab with different reinforcement layers in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces, e.g. one reinforcement layer in the precast element and the other reinforcement layer in the in-situ concrete supplement?","If only the ultimate limit state is considered, a different concrete cover can be defined for each reinforcement direction in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces. As soon as the serviceability limit state is included in the design, the two reinforcement directions must be adjacent. A different concrete cover for each reinforcement direction can then no longer be taken into account. Consideration of 3D design - shell When designing in a 3D structure, the element is considered as a shell. Both moments and normal forces can act here, which are transformed into design membrane forces. The required reinforcement is determined using these design membrane forces. In connection with the transformation from moments and normal forces, the smallest lever arm from both reinforcement directions is applied. Only one decisive lever arm is assumed for both directions. Consideration of 2D dimensioning - plate When dimensioning in a 2D structure, the surface element is considered as a plate. Only moments are effective, which are measured with the associated lever arm of the direction. The respective lever arm is therefore assumed for each direction."
"During the calculation in SHAPE-THIN I get warning no. 280345 ""The elements cross without connection. Would you like to cancel the check?"" What should I do?","The elements can be connected with the tool ""connect elements"". The function is called via the menu Extras → Connect elements or the corresponding button in the toolbar. In the working window, simply open a window over the area in which the elements are to be connected. The objects do not need to be fully captured. "
How can I save frequently used membrane materials in RFEM?,"There is a large number of technical membranes for lightweight surface structures. Polyester fabric (PES) coated with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) → called PES/ PVCWith polyvinyl chloride (PVC) coated polyester scrim (PES) Glass fabric coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) → called glass/PTFEPolyolefin coated polyester fabric (PES) Fluoroplastic coated polyester (PES) fabricSilicone coated glass fabricOpen and closed mesh fabricsUncoated and natural fabricsEthylene tetrafluoroethylene -Foils → called ETFEThese materials are to be selected depending on the construction task and the various properties for the respective project. With regard to the static calculation, all products have different load-bearing properties, which can vary in part with each manufacturing batch. In RFEM, these different values are linked in material table 1.3 with a suitable material model. There are model templates for the recurring use of materials in different models. This allows any list of specified membrane materials to be stored and loaded directly when opening a new model. In most cases, membrane materials always consist of an interaction of fixed material values and a material law. Since the existing material database only organizes materials with the material law ""isotropic linear elastic"", this database is not applicable for orthotropic membrane materials. "
Why are my cross-sections defined in RFEM not transferred to REVIT?,"In order for the cross-sections to be recognized when beams and columns are imported directly into REVIT, a corresponding family for these components must exist in the REVIT project to load your project. The interface then automatically recognizes all other cross sections and creates corresponding cross sections in the family. After importing the correct family type, this cross-section and all other cross-sections of the same type will be recognized and the import process will be completed successfully. "
Is it possible to design insulating glass with the add-on module RF-GLASS?,"Yes, you can specify the required structure of the glass pane in the ""1.2 Layers"" mask. In order to be able to define insulating glass, you must assign at least one glass layer to the structure. Then you get the additional selection option for the gas layer.After entering the gas layer, additional tabs appear in which you can enter further specific information for the design."
Several members are articulated at a node. How many member hinges are to be defined?,"If two members are articulated, only one of these members needs to be assigned the corresponding joint. With three members that are all articulated, two of the three members get the corresponding joint.In general, a fully articulated node with any number of member ends is assigned one member end hinge less than the existing number of member ends:Number of member ends: nNumber of member end hinges completely articulated connection: n-1If there are fewer than n-1 bar end joints, the respective bar ends are rigidly connected to each other without a joint. FIgure shows three variants of a main beam, on which a secondary beam connects:Completely rigid connection → no rod end hingePartially hinged connection: The secondary beam is hinged to the continuously rigid main beam → a rod end hinge Completely articulated connection: All three members are articulated → two member end hingesIf one member end hinge is used too much, the calculation may abort due to instability. Accordingly, the rule described above must be observed."
"Why does the form-finding process in a conical membrane arrangement not find a continuous, anticlastic form around the main axis?","The module RF-FORM-FINDING has two types of form-finding, which can alternatively be assigned to each initial surface input. The first variant called ""Standard"" shifts the relevant FE nodes in all 3 spatial directions X , Y, Z until the constant, specified surface tension of the membrane is in equilibrium with the edge reactions. The second option ""Projection"" holds the relative horizontal X', Y' Position of the FE nodes in relation to the normal plane of the surface tension reference axis and only shifts the vertical Z' position perpendicular to the plane until the modified surface tension, which is dependent on the membrane inclination, is in equilibrium with the edge reactions. In general, the ""Standard"" method is the appropriate choice for all non-tapered models. In the case of conical membrane shapes, using the standard method results in an ambiguous situation. Here the tangential stress component of the surface stress cancels each other out due to the circular arrangement and shifts all FE nodes independently of the radial position and surface stress magnitude to achieve the global equilibrium with consideration of the radial prestress component on the cone axis. In this case, to achieve a continuous conical shape, the projection method should be chosen. The resulting shape then maintains a non-constant final surface tension due to the projected surface tension specification. "
The project files are in the network. Is it possible for the project manager to display the same project structure for every employee? ,"The project manager is network-enabled so that project management can be organized at a central location. The directory structure in the project manager is saved in the PRO.DLP file. The PRO.DLP file (in which all projects are already integrated) is to be saved on a network drive to which the relevant employees have full access. The storage location for the PRO.DLP in the network drive must then be specified for all employees in the program options of the project manager. All users can make changes to the directory structure at the same time. For write access to the PRO.DLP file, this is only locked for a very short time and then released again immediately."
"How can I find crossing, unconnected members in the model?","The model check can be used to find members that cross each other but do not have a common node at the point of intersection. The model control can be done via menu Extras -> Model Control -> Crossing, unconnected members can be called up. The result is shown in the ""Groups of crossing, unconnected members"" section. The crossing bars are listed in groups; the current group is indicated by an arrow in the graphic.The ""What to do with"" section controls how the crossing members should be treated. The ""Connect Members"" option is suitable for actual transmission options for internal forces, but not e.g. e.g. for common crossings of diagonals with tension rods.Alternatively, the pairs of rods can also be output as an Excel list or visibilities can be generated with the model control. With the visibilities created in this way, the relevant members can be found and deleted very quickly in the model. The video shows how crossing unconnected bars without tension bars are displayed and then connected."
Why are the tolerance zones between the zone borders 5 km wide on the online snow load map of Austria?,"With the national appendix ÖNORM B 1991-1-3:2018-12, Austria has newly described the width of the tolerance zones. [1] In the 3rd paragraph under the chapter ""Appendix B "" the standard writes that within 2.5 km on both sides of the zone boundary, the characteristic value sk results from the average of the affected zones. In the Vienna area, 250 m on each side can be assumed. This results in a tolerance zone width of 2 x 2.5 km = 5 km in the state and 2 x 250 m = 500 m in Vienna.→ See Snow load map of AustriaThis specification was updated with the update to ÖNORM B 1991-1-3:2018 -12 on our website Snow load zones, wind zones and earthquake zones implemented.

How is the collapse reinforcement considered in RF-PUNCH Pro?,"collapse or tear-off reinforcement according to DIN EN 1992-1-1, 9.4.1 (3) is not output separately in RF-PUNCH Pro and must also be taken into account by the planner."
"Can I define temperature loads for members in RFEM or RSTAB, which e.g. B. 350 °C at the top of the bar beginning and 200 °C at the bottom of the bar?","This is possible: To do this, select the ""Temperature"" load profile for the member load and then specify a variable trapezoidal profile over the length and height of the cross-section."
How can I achieve a push contact with pull failure between a crossbar and a slightly curved membrane surface?,"The non-linear contact between cross bar and membrane can be done by a set of bar elements between the bar and the surface. This requires the rod to be eccentric in the plane of the compressive force resultant of the diaphragm action and the connection line of the diaphragm port. The geometric distance between the rod and the membrane itself must be aligned with the physical distance between the rod axis and the membrane connection. In order for the coupling to run homogeneously over the entire length of the coupling, an even arrangement is required with the same number of FE nodes on the rod axis and on the projected contact line on the membrane surface. This division and alignment of the FE nodes is achieved through a corresponding placement of topology nodes on the member axis and the corresponding contact line on the surface. The distance between the topology nodes should be chosen to match the selected mesh size of the adjoining membrane area. The coupling itself is to be carried out with a rigid rod between the pairs of nodes that fails non-linearly under compressive load. In this case, the mentioned non-linearity is to be implemented with a member non-linearity ""Failure under tension"". The connection of the rigid rod is fully compatible in the area of the eccentric rod (rigid) and is to be designed with a local free translation joint in the y/z axis in the area of the membrane related to the rigid rod axis. This contact modeling is able to transfer only compressive forces to the connected crossbeam due to the selected non-linearity and the alignment to the compressive force resultant in connection with the free translational joint. In the event of a suction load, the coupling components fail and the membrane moves away from the cross member unhindered."
How do I find the extreme values of the stresses or internal forces in a complex RFEM file? ,"The result output with result values on surfaces is very helpful for this.It is already preset that only extreme values are displayed. In addition, the result navigator can be used to set whether the extreme values should be displayed for the entire model, for all surfaces or solids, or for all local peak values."
I have entered a 2D frame and want to add a forked bearing to the ridge. Do I have to enter an intermediate support or a nodal support in RF-/STEEL EC3?,"You can either define the nodal support or the intermediate support in RF-/STEEL EC3. If you already have nodes in your actual RFEM or RSTAB model, then it is recommended to do so directly Input of the nodal support in dialog 1.7, because here you can pick the nodes directly in the model. If you want to consider intermediate storage at a point in a beam where you do not have a node in your actual system, then you can use the Use intermediate support and specify the position of the intermediate support (e.g. fork bearing) there."
How can I subsequently automatically generate load combinations in an existing file?,"To do this, open the ""Basic information"" dialog for the present model. To do this, simply right-click on the model name in the data navigator. Alternatively, the Open the ""Basic information"" dialog via the ""Edit"" menu. In the ""Basic data"" dialog you can select the standard according to which the combinatorics should be carried out. Or whether load combinations (LCs) or result combinations (EKs) should be created. If the existing file already contains LK's or EK's, you will be asked whether the program should delete or keep the existing combinations. "
In RF-CONCRETE Members I get the error message that the members of the set of members do not have the identical orientation and the set of members is excluded from the design. What should I do?,"The individual members of a set of members must have an identical orientation. In addition, the orientation of the members and the set of members must match.Solution:The orientation of the members and the set of members can be displayed and checked in the Show navigator . The orientation of a member or a set of members can be reversed via the context menu."
Is it possible to calculate walls as sandwich elements in RFEM 5 or RF-CONCRETE Surfaces?,"Unfortunately, the add-on module RF-CONCRETE Surfaces for RFEM 5 is not designed for the design of sandwich elements. Therefore, there is a lack of essential evidence for such components, such as e.g. B. the verification of the shear joint. Regardless of whether it is a wall or a slab. The bending design and especially the proof of the shear force resistance is designed for constant cross-sections. You can model the sandwich elements as surfaces with constant thickness and carry out the design for this in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces. Any additional evidence required would have to be provided manually separately."
"When I start the calculation in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces, I get the error message ""Calculation of deflection for the result combination not possible"". Why? What can I do to fix the problem?","The module extension RF-CONCRETE Deflect is available in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces for the calculation of the deformations in state II. RF-CONCRETE Deflect is required for the analytical calculation of the deformations in state II a clear load situation that is only given with the approach of the load combinations (LC's). Result combinations do not offer a clear load situation, regardless of whether they are additive or as an enveloping OR combination. For this reason, you receive the error message mentioned when setting up the EKs for the calculation of the deformations in RF-CONCRETE surfaces using RF-CONCRETE Deflect. To avoid the problem, you can simply generate load combinations (LC's) instead of result combinations (LC's). If you still want to carry out the verifications in the ultimate limit state with EKs, you can manually create an LC in addition to the existing EKs, for which you want to calculate the deformations using RF-CONCRETE Deflect. It is important that RF-CONCRETE Surfaces applies the load from the quasi-permanent design situation by default for the calculation of the deformations. This means that the LC for which the deformations are to be calculated must be defined as ""quasi-permanent"". Alternatively, the ticks for the settings of the design situations can also be configured user-defined."
"What does the Arrangement of new elements in ""Initial position"" and ""Tangential"" option mean in RF-STAGES?","The option controls how new structural elements in the build stages are applied to the already existing, deformed structure. Initial position:The new elements are applied with alignment to the initial position, i.e. the intended geometry. The deformations are compensated throughout the construction process. Theoretically, there is a kink in the geometry Tangential:The new elements are applied with the orientation of the already existing, deformed elements, i.e. tangential to them. The deformations are not evened out over the construction process. Theoretically, there is no kink in the geometry. "
"get an error message in RF-CONCRETE Members: ""Set of members no. is excluded from the calculation"". What does that mean?",The sets of members to be designed in the module must be based on the same or a uniform cross-section.A special feature is a set of members made of ribs. The same cross-section only results here if the integration width of the rib is chosen to be the same. There must therefore be a uniform rib type for the entire set of members.Tavened sets of members are only designed if the entire set of members has a linear cross-section.
"Why do I get different results when calculating the stresses of a flat steel, square or octagonal steel compared to the manual calculation? The shear stresses from shear force and torsion in particular deviate significantly.","The stress calculations are performed at the stress points of the cross-section. The cross-sections of the cross-section types Flat steelSquare steelHexagon steelOctagonal steelWide flat steelonly receive circumferential stress points at the corner points. If a bar with one of these cross-sections is subject to shear force or torsion, the solid cross-sections should be selected."
"I have changed my settings in the show navigator, apparently in an unfavorable way. Is there a way to reset it back to the default settings?","Yes, there is an option. To do this, switch to the Show navigator and right-click on any entry. A context menu then appears in which you will find the entry ""Dlubal Standard"". If you execute the ""Dlubal Standard"" command, the settings in the Show navigator are reset to the default values."
"How to show the center of a circle, arc, ellipse, etc.?","The display of the center of a circle, arc, ellipse, etc. can be controlled in Project Navigator - Show. To display, check the Model ->> Lines -> to activate midpoints. The midpoint can also be snapped."
"Why do I only see the total reinforcement under ""Required reinforcement"" in the results navigator and not the upper and lower reinforcement separately?","If one or more bars are designed with a circular cross-section, As,above and As,below are no longer specified: ""above"" and ""below"" are not definable for this cross-section; the reinforcement is inserted ""circumferentially"". Solution: Create a separate design case for the circular cross-sections (module menu ""File → New case"" ) and design the corresponding members separately. In the other design case, delete the members with a circular cross-section. After the design, As,above and As,below are displayed in the results navigator. "
"How can you realize a pure pressure connection between two surfaces, so that one wall leans against another wall?","You can realize such a connection with a line release. An example model where wall 1 should only transfer compressive forces to wall 2.First the dialog for creating a line release is opened. In the dialog you now select the lines for the release and the type. The type must also be created. The coordinate system of the line specifies the direction, so ""If vy positive"" must be selected as the release. "
Is it possible to output SHAPE-THIN printout reports with a cross-section image and the cross-section values and to include them in the RFEM or RSTAB report?,"It is not intended to transfer printout reports from one program to another. However, it is possible to include the SHAPE-THIN cross-section values and the SHAPE-THIN profile image in the RFEM or RSTAB printout report.Open the printout report selection and add the cross-section details of the SHAPE-THIN profile. The printout report is then generated with the graphic and the characteristic values of the SHAPE-THIN cross-section. "
Does activation of the partial safety factor GammaM influence the calculation in RF-GLASS?,"Yes. Since a different factor γM according to DIN 18008 is used to determine the permissible limit stress for different glasses, this is also stored in our material library. However, the consequence of this is that when this option is activated, the stiffness of the system is reduced by this factor.Especially when calculating volume body loads (climate loads), the reduced stiffness of the system also has an effect on the calculated stresses and Deformations."
Some employees in our company often have to perform complex calculations with RFEM. Is it possible to offload these calculations to a cluster?,Outsourcing the calculation to a cluster is not possible for RFEM. One way of relieving the work station computer of complex calculations is this:RFEM is installed on a hardware well-equipped terminal server installed. Every employee who has to carry out complex calculations has access to this server via remote desktop. Network licenses are required for this option.
"When generating loads, I want the gable trusses of a hall not to be loaded by the wind on the gable wall. Is that possible?","If the wind loads on the gable end are only to be transferred via the supports and not also via the ledger, this can be deactivated via the ""Correction of the generated loads"" setting in the load generator settings."
"If I only select a member, a surface or a volume, the rest is still shown in grey. Can I also hide the other elements completely?",User-defined views and visibilities can be defined in RFEM and RSTAB. The remaining or hidden structure is displayed in the background by default. You can use the project navigator - Show to deactivate this option so that only the selected section is visible and the rest of the structure is completely hidden. 
"When creating a solid, I keep getting the message ""The edges of the solid are not closed at the lines...."" What should I do?","The reason is usually that one or more surfaces of the volume to be generated have double lines. In this case, the boundary surfaces of the volume are not closed and the generation must be aborted. The program displays a corresponding message so that these lines can be found quickly.Solution:You can quickly identify double lines with the ""Extras → Model control → Find Overlapping Lines"". In this tool, the line pairs can also be output as an Excel list or sections can be generated. However, it is often the case that the lines cannot simply be deleted, since they are assigned to different objects. If you delete one of the lines, e.g. B. also deleted a surface. You should therefore first check for all components whether the lines can be deleted and if necessary change the boundary lines."
"used the EK's to calculate my reinforced concrete surfaces. However, the ""Related Load Cases"" are not displayed in the ""Surfaces - Local Deformations"" table. Is there a way to find these?","It is correct that in Table 4.13 ""Surfaces - Local Deformations"" no associated load cases are shown. But you can find them for example in Table 4.4 ""Members - Local Deformations"" . If you now want to see the associated load cases for the maximum deformation of an EC on a specific surface, you can integrate a member into this surface. So that this member does not affect the surface stiffness, e.g. For example, a very small cross-section can be used. If the member has been correctly integrated or meshed into the surface. You can now optionally click on the line in Table 4.4 with the desired result (e.g. max and z) by right-clicking. The context menu now offers the option ""Generate CO according to selected row"" with which a CO can be generated that contains the load cases associated with the selected value. If this command is executed, a LC with the associated load cases is obtained from an EK. with the results of the generated LK and the maximum deformations in the field under consideration."
"When I start the calculation, I get warning no. 30015 ""Inadmissible addition of load cases in a result combination!"". What can be the reason? ","Check if you entered ""nonlinearities"" in your structure. So for example ""failing bearings"", ""members with non-linearities (compression or tension members)"" or ""non-linear material behavior"". As soon as you try If you use result combinations to add the load cases in such structures, this warning appears. When adding the load cases of the result combination (EK), only the Results of the individual load cases added up. This means that you may not be able to map the ""non-linearities"" correctly, because a member e.g. B. fails in one load case, but not in another load case. When using the EK's you would add the results from different static systems. This leads to incorrect results. Use the load combinations (LC's) for these cases. A large load case (load combination) is created here and this load situation is calculated in summary. This allows you to correctly map the non-linearities in the system. Alternatively - if a calculation with the EK's is desired due to the calculation time - you can consider whether the non-linearities are absolutely necessary become."
Where can I enter the distances between the crane axes?,"The distances between the crane axes can be entered in mask ""1.4 Load"" within the crane parameters depending on the number of crane axes. "

"have created new elements in my model. However, these are not measured. What can I do?","In most cases, the new elements must first be added to the relevant module. The checkmark for ""all"" is not set. Therefore, new elements must be added manually."
Can the viewer for RSTAB or RFEM be installed on an iPad or an Android tablet?,"The viewers for RSTAB and RFEM are nothing more than full versions with limited functionality. RSTAB and RFEM are Windows applications for the x86 processor architecture that is used in the vast majority of desktop computers and notebooks. The tablets use a different processor architecture (ARM) and different operating systems. But there is a way to use the viewer. To do this, you would have to install a remote desktop client (e.g. that from Microsoft) on your tablet. This allows you to remotely control your computer in the office via the tablet."
It is not possible to create a rib on some lines in my model. Several error messages appear.,"Ceilings or walls are usually connected to one another in an articulated manner so that moments from the ceiling slab are not transferred to the walls. If there is also a line hinge and a beam (rib) on the same line, then it makes a big difference to which face the line hinge was assigned. SolutionSince the rib is usually assigned to the slab, the line hinge should be assigned to the wall. If this is not the case, an error message appears and the creation of the rib must be aborted plate margins. If a line hinge was erroneously created at this point, an error message is also displayed when creating the rib."
"Why is the strength for the design always reduced with a kmod value of 0.6 in the RF-LAMINATE module, even though I have load combinations with variable loads?","In the RF-LAMINATE module, it depends on whether you are designing a result combination or the load combinations in it.Select the load combinations for the design in the general data, see above these are carried out with the shortest duration of action of the load cases contained therein. However, if you select the associated result combination for the design, the load combinations in it are not calculated, but rather the envelope of the result combination. Since it is not clear in the case of an envelope from which load cases the maximum or minimum value results, the load duration of ""constant"" is used for the design on the safe side for this result combination. However, this input can be changed in window 1.4.The advantage of designing the result combination is the faster calculation and is particularly advantageous for a preliminary design in very large systems. If the decisive load cases are known, we recommend modifying the load duration class in window 1.4.If you want to carry out a more precise calculation, please always select the appropriate load combinations for the design in the general data."
Is the punching load in RF-PUNCH Pro taken from the support forces of the line supports when verifying a wall corner? Over what length are the bearing forces applied?,"RF-PUNCH Pro only uses the support forces in the punching verification for nodal supports. For the punching verification at wall corners and ends, the support force from the line supports is not used, but the shear force from the critical one round cut. This has the advantage that a punching load can also be determined if a wall was entered in a 3D model instead of a line support. This procedure in the module is therefore more general and can be applied independently of the type of modelling. You can also find more information on determining the punching load at wall corners and wall ends in a technical article on our homepage, which you can open via the following link."
Why does my calculation in the RF-/ALUMINUM add-on module take so long?,"The calculation core of the cross-section program SHAPE-THIN is used by default in the RF-/ALUMINUM add-on module to determine the stresses of the effective cross-section in an iterative process. This method is precise because all corners and edges of the cross section are recorded, but can be very time-consuming in the case of complex profiles. Alternatively, the effective cross section determined by a simplified analytical procedure, which runs much faster. With this approach, corners, roundings, etc. are neglected and subsequently compensated using a factor. There is no iterative calculation. The effective cross-section values can therefore be higher than with the SHAPE-THIN calculation. In such a case, it is advisable to carry out the calculation with the analytical method and then only to design the decisive component with the decisive load combination with the SHAPE-THIN solution.

"With my student license and with the trial version, I get a watermark across the page in the printout report. Can this be disabled?","As a student and test user, you have the advantage of being able to use the entire Dlubal software (apart from the DICKQ module) free of charge and without restrictions. The only evil that you have to put up with is the watermark in the printout report. This cannot be deactivated and is intended to prevent commercial use."
Is the statically indeterminate part of the internal forces due to prestressing considered in RF-TENDON? ,"Yes, this one is taken into account. The internal forces due to prestress can also be output accordingly Primary forces: statically determined portion of the internal forces due to prestress Secondary forces: statically indeterminate part of the internal forces due to prestress In order to be able to display the individual parts, a new result class (EK) must be created in which only the prestressed load case is selected. "
Is it possible to create a scissors joint between surfaces?,"You can realize a scissors joint between surfaces using line releases. In the attached model, a line release was created on line 5, which releases areas 3 and 4. Since surfaces 3 and 4 also automatically refer to the newly generated line 8, the scissor joint is correctly defined."
Is it possible in RFEM to rotate the result values by 90°?,"Result values can be rotated by any angle. With this setting, all result values are rotated. So far, it is not possible to define different alignments for individual walls and ceilings."
Is it possible to use RSTAB and RFEM on a Microsoft Surface Tablet?,"In principle, our software runs on a Microsoft Surface tablet with an Intel processor. Make sure that the tablet is equipped with the 64-bit version of Windows 10. The current versions of RSTAB and RFEM are only available for 64-bit Windows.However, one problem is that these tablets are all only equipped with an Intel graphics chip. The OpenGL implementation in its graphics driver is not particularly good. This can lead to crashes. A problem with the graphics driver can be that the nodes are not displayed in the graphics in RSTAB and RFEM."
"Unfortunately, I currently have the problem that the calculation in RF-SOILIN takes an extremely long time and does not converge. What should I do?","These problems can often be remedied very easily and effectively. Especially in the edge areas of slabs, it is often the case that the results oscillate. In this case, the result can usually be improved by modeling a bedding collar of negligible thickness around the surface. This is assigned the same bedding as the main slab. The edge area of the slab is reproduced more precisely by the bedding collar and the convergence behavior is often better. It is important that the bedding collars reach at least as far that the settlement trough has completely subsided. This also makes it possible to graphically depict the influence of the settlement on the surrounding buildings. "
"The ""Edge beam"" function is available in the RX-TIMBER module. What exactly does this option do?",This option is used to determine whether an edge beam is to be designed during the design or an inner beam which is arranged between the individual fields. The load approach differs as follows: Inner beam:${\mathrm q}_{\mathrm k}\;=\;{\mathrm q}_{\mathrm k'}\;\cdot\;\mathrm a\;\cdot\;\mathrm k$ Edge beam:${\mathrm q}_{\mathrm k}\;=\;{\mathrm q}_{\mathrm k'}\;\cdot\;\left(\frac{\mathrm a}2 \;+\;\mathrm ü\right)\;\cdot\;\mathrm k$ a = beam or rafter spacingü = roof overhang at the gablek = load coefficient for flow effectpk' = distributed load in kN/m² .
How are surfaces correctly defined in the main mask of RFEM with layer structure? So far I have only found the input of the layer structure in the RF-GLASS module.,"When designing glass with the add-on module RF-GLASS, the layer structure is defined in the module (mask 1.2). The layer structure in the main window of RFEM is irrelevant here, since the module creates a temporary calculation model during the calculation. It is only important that the Glass surface stiffness has been set.The same applies to the mounting of the pane. This is also completely defined in RF-GLASS.On our website you will find an interesting webinar about RF-GLASS on the topic ""Design of glass structures in RFEM""."
Which forces have to be exchanged between the RX-TIMBER BSH program and the RX-TIMBER Association program?,"The RX-TIMBER Brace program is usually used to calculate the bracing of gable roof girders with variable cross-section heights. These can be dimensioned in the RX-TIMBER BSH program. From the RX-TIMBER BSH program, the user receives the equivalent loads per beam, broken down for each load case. The calculation is based on Section 9.2.5.3 of EC5. This equivalent load must be adopted in the RX-TIMBER Association program for the identical load cases. The normal forces calculated by the RX-TIMBER Association program must in turn be used as additional Forces can be defined in the RX-TIMBER BSH program. A distinction must be made here between the compressive force in the upper chord of the association and the tensile force in the lower chord of the association. Both normal forces must be applied separately. The tensile forces of the bottom chord result in a deflection force in the spatial system that can be applied as an additional moment. "
Some nodes are outside of a plane. What is the easiest way to move these to the desired level?,"For planes that are perpendicular to the global coordinate system, it is relatively easy, since one coordinate of all points in the plane must be identical. However, if it is a plane that is generally in space, you must first create a user-defined coordinate system and then move the node in the user-defined coordinate system. The fastest option however, is the ""Project"" function (see video). This allows nodes that are outside of one of the target levels to be quickly moved into it."
Can I extend a line or staff by a specific length or to another line or staff? ,"Yes, both are possible. If you click on a member or a line with the right mouse button, you can call up the ""Extend line"" or ""Extend member"" function via the context menu. "
My model is unstable. What could be the cause?,"A calculation abort due to an unstable system can have various reasons. On the one hand, it can indicate a ""real"" instability due to system overload, but on the other hand, modeling inaccuracies can also be responsible for this error message. Below is one possible approach to find the cause of the instability.1. Control of the modelingFirst of all, it should be checked whether the system is in order from the modeling point of view. For this purpose, it is advisable to use the model controls provided by RFEM/RSTAB (Extras → Model Control). These options can be used, for example, to find identical nodes and overlapping members and delete them if necessary. Furthermore, you can use the structure e.g. B. under pure self-weight in a load case according to the first-order theory. If results are then output, the structure is stable in terms of modeling. If this is not the case, the most common causes are listed below (see also the ""Model check"" video in the ""Downloads"" area): Wrong definition of supports / lack of supports This can lead to instabilities since the system is not supported in all directions, therefore it is necessary that the bearing conditions are compatible with the system as well as with the external ones Boundary conditions are in equilibrium.Statically underdetermined systems can also lead to the calculation aborting due to a lack of boundary conditions. Torsion of bars around their own axis If bars twist around their own axis, i.e. the bar is not held around its own axis, this can lead to instability. The cause is often the settings of the bar end joints. It is possible that torsion hinges were introduced at both the start and end nodes.However, a message window at the start of the calculations draws the user's attention to this. Bars not connected Especially with larger and more complex models, it can quickly happen that some bars are not connected to each other and are therefore ""free in floating in the air"". Forgetting to cross bars that should actually intersect can also lead to instabilities. A remedy is provided by the ""Crossing, not connected members"" model check, which searches for members that cross but do not have a common node at the intersection. No common node The nodes appear to be in the same place, but on closer inspection they differ slightly from each other. Frequent causes are CAD imports, which can be cleaned up using the model control. Formation of a link chain Too many member end releases at a node can cause a link chain, which leads to the calculation being aborted. Only n-1 hinges with the same degree of freedom referred to the global coordinate system may be defined per node, where ""n"" is the number of connected members. The same applies to line joints. 2. Checking the bracing. A missing bracing also leads to aborted calculations due to instabilities. It should therefore always be checked whether the supporting structure is sufficiently braced in all directions. 3. Numerical problems. It is an articulated frame, which is reinforced by tension rods. Due to the shortening of the leg as a result of the vertical loads, the tension rods receive small compressive forces in the first calculation run. They will be removed from the system (since only train can be picked up). In the second calculation run, the model is then unstable without these tension rods. There are several ways to solve this problem. You can give the tension members a prestress (member load) in order to ""eliminate"" the small compressive forces, assign a small stiffness to the members or have the members removed one after the other in the calculation. 4. Finding the cause of an instability Automatic model control with graphical output To display the To obtain the cause of instability, the module RF- STABLE (RFEM). Supposedly unstable systems can be calculated with the ""Determine mode shape of the unstable model"" option. An eigenvalue analysis is carried out using the structural data so that the instability of the affected component is graphically displayed as a result. Bifurcation problem Load cases or load combinations can be calculated according to the 1st order theory and the calculation increases only from the 2nd order theory, there is a stability problem (critical load factor less than 1.00). The critical load factor specifies the factor by which the load must be multiplied in order for the model to become unstable (e.g. buckle) under the associated load. It follows: A critical load factor smaller than 1.00 means that the system is unstable. Only a positive critical load factor greater than 1.00 allows the statement that the load due to the specified axial forces multiplied by this factor leads to buckling failure of the stable system. In order to be able to find the ""weak point"", the following procedure is recommended, which the module RSBUCK (RSTAB) or RF-STABILITY (RFEM) (see also video ""Bifurcation problem"" in the ""Downloads"" area). First, the load of the affected load combination should be reduced until the load combination becomes stable The load factor in the calculation parameters of the load combination is used as an aid. This also corresponds to a manual determination of the critical load factor if the module RSKNICK or RF-STABLE is not available. For purely linear structural elements, it can be sufficient to calculate the load combination according to the first-order theory and select it directly in the additional module. Subsequently, based on this load combination, the buckling or buckling figure can be calculated and graphically displayed in the corresponding add-on module. The ""weak point"" in the system is identified through the graphical output and can then be specifically optimized. By default, the modules RSKNICK or RF-STABLE only global mode shapes. In order to also capture local eigenmodes, the member division should be activated (RF-STABILITY) or the division for truss members should be increased to at least ""2"" (RSBUCK)."
Is the longitudinal reinforcement defined in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces taken into account when determining internal forces in RFEM?,"No, the basic reinforcement defined in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces is not taken into account when determining internal forces in RFEM. The internal forces are determined in RFEM with the modulus of elasticity of the selected concrete. The amount of reinforcement (linear-elastic calculation, state I) has no influence here. The situation is different if you carry out a non-linear design in state II in the serviceability limit state with the add-on module RF -PERFORM CONCRETE NL. Here you specify an existing basic reinforcement, which is to be taken into account for the non-linear calculation in state II. The determination of the internal forces is carried out with the non-linear design (only available for the SLS) with the effective stiffness (state II). The reinforcement defined here has an influence on the internal forces. You can evaluate these internal forces (from state II with the influence of the defined reinforcement) in the Execute results from RF-CONCRETE Surfaces.

"Where can you change the steel grade of the crane runway girder? Although I have set St 37.2 in RSTAB, only S235 is used for the calculation in KRANBAHN.","The steel grade used is specified in the 1.1 General Data window of the CRANEWAY program (not in the RSTAB8 user interface). The steel grades that depend on the selected standard are available in the list. You can select the steel St 37 if you select the design standard ""DIN 4132"".. When selecting EN1993-6 you can also create your own custom material and use this for the design. "
have to recalculate an existing foundation and am looking for a design according to DIN 1045 or DIN 1054. Only the Eurocode is available in RF-/FOUNDATION Pro. Do you have another module with which I could prove the foundation?,"As you correctly mentioned, the design according to EN 1992-1-1 or EN 1997-1 is available in RF-FOUNDATION Pro. The reinforced concrete design according to DIN 1045-1 or DIN 1045 or the geotechnical verifications according to DIN 1054 can be carried out in the previous module RF-/FOUNDATION. You will find the additional module RF-/FOUNDATION in the data Navigator under the additional modules as well as in the menu under ""Add-on modules"" > ""Foundations"". In the detailed settings you can set the standard according to which the reinforced concrete design is to be carried out."
"How can I rotate, turn or move an imported DXF that I have saved as a background slide into the correct view? ","The easiest way to rotate the DXF file as a background layer is via the project navigator Data → Auxiliary objects → Background layers, via the context menu around any axis."
Can I speed up the calculation in RFEM by equipping the computer with more RAM?,"It depends on the specific case. If the iterative solver has to be used because there is not enough memory to use the direct solver, then it makes sense to expand the memory so that the direct solver can be used. There are limits that are set by the hardware (processor, mainboard) and the operating system.If the RAM is sufficient to use the direct solver, then further upgrading the RAM only slightly speeds up the calculation . "
How can you display the results of a line release or a line hinge?,"The course of the results of a line release or a line joint can be displayed by right-clicking on the relevant line release or line joint. The ""Result curves"" entry must then be selected from the context menu.The video shows how the results of a line release/line hinge can be displayed in the work window and in the ""Result curves"" dialog."
"I would like to model a connection with RAHMECK Pro for a comparison, but I have problems with the screw spacing. Do other distances apply or have I overlooked something?","The difference may be due to the standard wrench dimensions, which require minimum dimensions in some places. This makes the exact calculation more difficult.RF-/FRAMEECK Pro checks whether the spanner dimensions allow the assembly of the connection. The standard dimensions or a user specification can be used. To ensure screwability, the dimensions D and L of a standard socket wrench insert and b and h of a torque wrench are given.You can change these dimensions to get the desired dimensions. You reach the corresponding dialog via the ""Details"" button and the ""Wrench dimensions"" button there."
used RF-IMP to generate a pre-deformed replacement model using a pre-deformed FE mesh. Is the equivalent model now taken into account for all load combinations or do I have to make additional settings?,"The pre-deformed equivalent model is not automatically activated for the load combinations. You have to set this manually in the calculation parameters of the load combination. Activate the ""Additional options"" there and activate the ""Initial deformation from module RF-IMP"" option. To activate the option in several load combinations at the same time, simply use the multiple option to mark load combinations. The calculation with the pre-deformed FE mesh is carried out if the corresponding load combination according to theory II. or III. Order are calculated. "
Can I also rotate a foundation around the Z axis in the RF-FOUNDATION Pro add-on module?,"Yes, that is possible. If a nodal support is arranged at a certain angle in RSTAB or RFEM, the geometry of the foundation is also oriented to the node according to this coordinate system."
I have imported structural data using the import functions or direct interfaces. How does the material assignment work so that the design modules also accept the materials?,"In most cases only the name of the material is passed. If the name differs from the Dlubal material database name, neither the basic parameters (Young's modulus, shear modulus, etc.) nor the additional parameters (yield points, tensile strength, limit strains, etc.) are defined. In these cases, not even the internal forces of the structure can be determined. Some interfaces (e.g. Revit) are able to transfer the basic parameters. However, problems arise here with the design modules, since these require additional material properties. However, these are only available as information in the Dlubal-specific databases. This issue can be solved by combining the name of the imported material with the unique name of the Dlubal material database linked. This linking can be done via the conversion tables. You can access the tables via ""File"" - ""Import"" in the ""Detailed settings"" tab. Handling is relatively easy. The material name from the export file or the CAD application must be entered on the left-hand side. On the right side the name according to the Dlubal material database. This can also be called directly. If you have several entries with a similar spelling, so-called ""regular expressions"" can be used. Further help for this can be found in the conversion file itself. The path can be seen in the detailed settings. The user is required to create his own tables. Due to the large number of programs and spellings, Dlubal cannot provide any tables."
Which modules can be addressed via the COM interface RS-COM or RF-COM?,The COM interface gives you access to most operating elements and the results of the following programs or additional modules:RF-/STEEL (members)RF-/STEEL EC3RF-/ALUMINIUMRF-/CONCRETERF-STABILRF-/WOOD ProRF-/DYNAM Pro
Is it possible to check the selected effective widths graphically when entering ribs in RFEM?,"There are several ways to control the effective widths of the ribs graphically. Among other things, directly when entering the rib in RFEM. In the RF-CONCRETE Members module, the cross-section graphic is displayed below Table 1.4 Ribs. The graphic shows the equivalent cross-section used for the design. The Reinforcement - Rendering option in the Project Navigator - Results allows display the bar, reinforcing bars and stirrups in the RFEM work window."
"Is it possible to control the Dlubal-specific member types in Revit? For example, the round bars of a wind bracing should be transferred as tension bars and not as beam bars. ","This is conditionally possible. So-called ""Dlubal parameters"" can be activated in Revit for the member types ""tension member"" and ""truss member"". After activation, these two parameters can be controlled in the analytical member properties. RFEM reads this information during the import from Revit and assigns the assigned member types to the corresponding members. The procedure is shown in the attached video. When exporting from RFEM to Revit, the Dlubal parameters are automatically activated. The member types are assigned according to the RFEM file. Member types that are not supported are stored indirectly as ""beams"". "
"In an RFEM model with a plastic material model, how can you determine which plastic deformation remains after unloading?","You can do this with the RF-LOAD-HISTORY module. It is important that the material model ""Plastic 2D/3D"" or ""Plastic 1D"" is used. This recording of a Dlubal info tags shown."
"I have activated the settlement calculation in FOUNDATION Pro, but I cannot export the determined stiffnesses of the nodal supports. Why not?","With the default setting of the settlement calculation in RF-/FOUNDATION Pro, the foundation slab is analyzed as a ""slack slab"". The export of the bearing spring constants from RF-/FOUNDATION Pro is only available then available if the calculation was previously carried out as ""rigid plate"". To do this, open the ""Details"" and the ""Settings for the settlement calculation"" and select there the ""Iterative calculation of the base stress using a rigid foundation plate"". After the calculation using a rigid foundation plate, the option for exporting the bearing spring constants is available in the RF-/FOUNDATION file menu Per available."
"I haven't been able to save properly lately? Unfortunately, the cause cannot be identified.","There are several reasons that can prevent the model from being saved: Virus scanner Please add exceptions for real-time scanning in the virus scanner or temporarily disable it directly. You can find out which paths should be added to the exceptions under following entry: Settings for the virus scanner User rightsMake sure the user has sufficient rights. The document mentioned in the Downloads contains detailed information on this. It is recommended to start the installation file using the context menu (right-click) option ""Run as administrator"". Windows UpdatesMake sure your operating system is up to date and has the latest updates installed. This is often a problem with older operating systems (Windows 7/8) since the updates can be deactivated manually. With Windows 10, the updates are usually installed automatically. Program updateIn the program there is the possibility of an automatic search for updates: Choose the menu ""Options → Program options"". In the Program tab of the dialog you can then specify whether and after how many days the program should search for updates. In the ""Help"" menu you can also manually enter a Start checking for updates. Storage locationSometimes it is also the case that settings on the server have been changed. This sometimes means that the user no longer has access rights and it is no longer possible to save. It is therefore advisable to save the model locally on the computer. If this is successful, you should check the network settings again. DeinstallationIf none of these attempts have helped, it can help if you completely uninstall all Dlubal applications and install the programs ""fresh"" again."
"In RF-/DYNAM Pro I get the error message: ""The assigned mass case does not exist"" although I have defined a mass case. Why is that?","Before you can start the calculation in the additional module, you should check each register. This message appears if you have not opened the calculation parameters of the natural vibration case at least once. A mass case has been defined, but has not yet been assigned to the natural vibration case. "
Is it possible to integrate your own programs into the RFEM program interface?,"Your own programs can be added to the ""Add-on modules > External add-on modules"" menu.For this, the file ""C:\Program Files\Dlubal\RFEM 5.XX\RFEM.ini"" must have a text editor to be opened. The text editor must run with administrator rights.The following three lines show how the Windows text editor Notepad can be inserted into the menu:ModuleName2=Notepad ModuleExeName2 =C:\WINDOWS\System32\notepad.exe ModuleDescription2=Editor"
Can flat slabs also be designed in RF-TENDON and RF-TENDON Design?,"The module is designed for prestressing in immediate or in post bond. The templates for the tendon geometry are based on parabolic curves. This means that the modules are not explicitly designed for the design of flat ceilings. Possible illustration: The geometric course for the free tendon position cannot be determined automatically by the modules. However, a user-defined tendon course can be taken as a basis. Prestressing without bond could be done by adjusting the coefficients of friction. The deformation analysis can be done in the modules RF-TENDON and RF-TENDON Design are not listed. Here, however, a deformation analysis on the RFEM side in connection with RF-BETON NL or RF -BETON Deflect using the equivalent prestressing loads. The equivalent prestressed loads are exported without the influence of long-term losses and would have to be reduced in RFEM using a factor corresponding to these losses. "
How can I control a reduction in stiffness for surfaces on a load-by-load basis?,"First you have to select the type of stiffness modification to be carried out in the ""Modify stiffness"" tab in the editing dialog for the respective surface. For example, using the ""multiplication factors"". Multiplication factors can be specified here for the various stiffness components (e.g. membrane stiffness). The calculation parameters control whether these factors or the set stiffness modification are used in the individual load cases or load combinations. This now means that the modification is taken into account as soon as the check mark is set. If the tick is removed, the modification is not taken into account for the surfaces. In this way, the stiffness modification can be controlled by load case or load combination."
Can I enter and design a reinforced concrete area with a reinforcement layer in the middle of the area?,"No, unfortunately this is not possible. The program concept of RF-CONCRETE Surfaces is designed in such a way that reinforcement must always be inserted on the top and bottom layers. If necessary, you can try to concentrate the individual reinforcement layers in the middle of the area. It is important to ensure that the individual reinforcement layers do not ""touch"" each other. Otherwise there is an error message."

"I get Warning #469 ""Lines [line numbers] lying in the plane cross each other and have no common node"". If I confirm the warning with ""No"", error no. 639 ""Error no. 11 when generating the FE mesh!"" issued. What should I do?","The intersection of the lines mentioned in the warning is to be created using the ""Connect lines/members"" function. To do this, select the ""Connect lines/members"" function and then open a window over the elements to be intersected. Afterwards the rods are placed eccentrically. Please consider that the lines and thus also the bars are automatically integrated into the area. Since the stiffening bracing is usually only intended to transfer axial forces, it is advisable to remove it from the surfaces so that the surface and member are not bonded. To do this, the corresponding lines must be removed from the area in the ""Integrated"" tab."
I would like to increase my internal forces by 10% and use them to carry out the design in the additional modules. Is the?,"Yes, this is possible. In the calculation parameters of each load case or each load combination you will find the option ""Multiply load by factor"". You can check this and enter a factor by which the load is multiplied for the calculation of the internal forces of this load case/load combination. "
"How can I use the RF-/JOINTS Steel - Column Base add-on module, e.g. B. choose a tube as a shear anchor?","When using a shear anchor, a profile that already exists in the RFEM /RSTAB model can be selected from the list. For example, if you want to use a pipe for shear transfer, this must already have been created as a cross-section in the RSTAB / RFEM model. Another cross-section can also be specified using the ""Transfer cross-section from library"" button Material can be defined (unless the Use column material for other connection parts check box is activated in window 1.1 General Data). The materials of the support, base plate and shear dowel therefore do not have to be identical. The length of the shear dowel must be specified in the input field."
have RFEM and Revit installed but buttons for direct export/import to Revit are missing. What can I do?,"First of all, make sure that the respective RFEM/RSTAB version and the Revit version are the same status. In the best case, you have installed the current versions.If the plugin is missing in Revit, you can install it as follows:1. Go to the following folder, yes by system:32-bit system: ""C:\Program Files\Common Files\Dlubal\DLInstaller""64-bit system: ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Dlubal\DLInstaller""2.

How to delete load combinations or result combinations?,"There is a difference between manually generated and automatically generated Distinguish load combinations or result combinations.Manually generated load combinations or result combinations are displayed in the tables or in the ""Edit load cases and combinations"" window in black font color and automatically generated load combinations or result combinations in blue font color. Manually generated load combinations or result combinations can be deleted via the project navigator - data, via the table or the ""Edit load cases and combinations"" window. The load or result combinations to be deleted must first be selected and then the ""Delete"" command must be selected. Automatically generated load or result combinations can be deleted via the Edit Model Credentials window. To do this, first deactivate the ""Create combinations automatically"" check box. In the ""Delete automatically generated combinations"" window that opens, select the ""Delete"" button. If only individual load or result combinations are to be deleted, click the ""Keep"" button. The relevant load or result combinations can then be deleted."
"Why is the result of the formula calculation too small by a factor of 1000 compared to the numerical calculation, even though there are no dimensions?","When entering formulas with values without dimensions, it is assumed that the units are in SI. If the unit you are looking for is not an SI unit but a multiple of it (e.g. kN instead of N), the result is factored accordingly. In the example in the picture, 1000 N/m would be =1 kN/m."
Can I reduce the presentation of the result values or the number of result values in a critical perimeter?,"When displaying the punching loads based on the shear force in the critical perimeter, RFEM uses internal sections. The critical perimeter automatically receives an internal division. The result values are thus determined at each FE mesh node and at the internal division points. In the display navigator, either all values or only the extreme value can be output for the sections. A coarser classification or output of the values cannot be set. "
Is there a possibility to also use nonlinear material behavior in the time history analysis?,"In order to be able to consider non-linearities in the dynamics, you need the add-on module RF-/DYNAM Pro - non-linear time-history method. In RSTAB and RFEM, this module differs in the type of nonlinearities to be applied.RSTAB - Nonlinear Time History AnalysisNonlinear member types such as tension and compression members and cablesBar nonlinearities such as failure, cracking and yielding in tension or compressionSupport nonlinearities such as failure, friction, diagram and partial actionHinged nonlinearities such as friction, partial action, diagram and fixed at positive or negative internal forcesRFEM - nonlinear time history analysisIn addition to the nonlinearities mentioned above, nonlinear material behavior can be used."
"changed the background color to ""white"", now I can't see the ""Values on surfaces"" anymore? Why? How can I control this correctly?","You have probably changed the background color to ""white"" in the ""Standard configuration with black background"". A white text for the ""Values on surfaces"" is now displayed on a white background. This is not correct and the text is therefore not visible. In RFEM 5 and RSTAB 8 there are ""configurations"" for this application. The configuration manager can be opened via the ""Options"" menu. If you want to set a white background, you can simply double-click on the ""Standard configuration with white background"" entry. The background color will then change to white. But not only the background color, but also the colors for all other settings, so that the display of the entire program is adapted to the white background color. This avoids the problem of ""white text on a white background"". If you accidentally set the configuration unfavorably, you can change it using the button shown in Illus. 02 reset to default values."
Why does the previous authorization not allow you to start the new RFEM version 5.19?,"Our authorization has a service entry. This entry describes whether a customer has purchased our software from us with a valid service contract (Basic, Pro) or without a service contract. In the case of a service contract, the entry contains the end date related to the service contract concluded with us. This form of authorization then accepts all assigned versions with a creation date before this date. For the other case without a service contract, only the version number current at the time of software purchase ( e.g. 5.19 - major version number.minor version number). In this variant, authorization only accepts associated versions with the same major and minor version number. "
"When inserting multiple blocks in RSTAB or RFEM, new materials and new cross-sections are created each time, even though they are identical. How can you combine them when you insert them?","In the detail settings when inserting the block, you can select what should happen if the materials and cross-sections are identical. If these are to be combined. Then the new materials and cross-sections are combined with those in RSTAB or RFEM. If the blocks have already been inserted, you can also combine the materials and cross-sections afterwards. It is only important that the materials are combined first and then the cross-sections, since a material is always assigned to a cross-section. In order to open the context menu with the ""Merge identical materials"" option, you must first click in one of the cells in column A with the left mouse button and then start the context menu with the right mouse button."
Can stiffening systems be calculated with Dlubal Software?,"You can easily do the pre-dimensioning of bracing systems with our SHAPE-THIN module. This allows the individual wall sections to be modeled and calculated using the theory of bracing systems. As a result, you will receive information about the center of gravity, shear center and details about the cross-sectional properties of the individual sections. It is also possible to determine the individual shear forces in the walls. For more information, see the links provided under this FAQ."
What is the unbalanced equation solver good for?,"The unsymmetric solver can improve convergence. However, it should only be activated if there are really convergence problems. For certain material models, you will also be prompted to turn on the unbalanced solver. With the ""normal"" equation solver, only one side of the matrix needs to be saved because it is symmetrical to the main diagonal. With the asymmetrical equation solver, both sides must be saved and, of course, generated beforehand. This requires more memory and the processing time is longer. For a model that already converges well, the asymmetric solver just adds more computation time and is of no use."
I have calculated buckling lengths for my model with RSBUCK/RF-STABILITY. Which buckling lengths are relevant for further investigations?,"RSBUCK/RF-STABILITY calculate at least one critical load factor or critical load and an associated buckling figur. The buckling length is then recalculated from the critical load. Since this analysis is not performed for individual local components, but only for the complete structure, the load distribution factors determined from this also refer to the global structure and not to the local elements. However, it can and will happen that with some load distribution factors, the structure fails globally but also fails locally (depending on stiffness and normal force state). The buckling lengths calculated in this way should therefore only be used for the members , which also buckle in the respective buckling figur. If a structure fails globally, it is therefore difficult to draw conclusions about the buckling behavior of individual members. A structure in which the rear supports buckle. Therefore, only the buckling lengths calculated for these two supports should be used.General again: Buckling lengths from the RSBUCK module are only valid for a component in the respective direction if the associated buckling figure is clearly opposite the member ""bulges"" the other in the respective direction. It is quite clear that the normal forces also have an effect on the results here."
"would like to have the programs installed on the D:\ drive instead of C:\. Unfortunately, the program does not allow me to do this for some folders. What can I do?","If the program has already been installed on the computer, the path details for the folders for the general data and the projects are grayed out in the Installation Wizard. Subsequent changes are therefore no longer permitted. Only after all Dlubal applications have been uninstalled can these paths be accessed during a new installation. "
"In connection with the non-linear calculation in the serviceability limit state design, I get implausibly large values for the crack width and the deformation in the RF-CONCRETE modules. What is the cause and how can I fix the problem?","In connection with the non-linear calculation, it should be noted that the reinforcement is not increased automatically. A non-linear calculation is based on an existing reinforcement. This existing reinforcement can, for example, result from the verification of the load-bearing capacity or a defined basic reinforcement. The reinforcement applied for the SLS checks can be output graphically. Cause of the problem: Should there be no reinforcement from the ULS or the basic reinforcement in some areas, the serviceability check is carried out without applied reinforcement and it is possible, eg with the crack width, very high results result. Solution of the problem: It should be ensured that there is reinforcement in each area of the system. This can be implemented by applying a basic reinforcement. "
Where can I download the current program version?,"Customers with a service contract will find the download links in their Dlubal account under the category ""Products for download"". You can log into your Dlubal account on our website in the upper area or alternatively in the program via Help → Dlubal Online → My Account. In the new program generation (RFEM 6, RSTAB 9 , RSECTION 1,...) you can also access the download area via the Dlubal Center. "
Can I align a nodal support in RSTAB 8 to a rotated member without having to measure and enter the angle myself?,"Yes, this is possible. On the one hand you can determine the rotation around the Z, Y or X axis by selecting 2 or 3 nodes. You can find the command in the button to the right of the input field for the rotation angle. If you entered a member that is rotated about its own axis (e.g. a purlin on a pitched roof), then you can use the ""member rotation ß"" for the rotation of the nodal support. "
How can I relate a scissors joint to a local axis system?,"Scissor joints can only be related to the global coordinate system. It is therefore not possible to refer to a local axis system. However, there is also the option of relating the scissor joint to a global rotated axis system. A sample rotated scissor joint file can be downloaded from the link below."
"In RF-PUNCH Pro, in the ""1.4 Longitudinal Reinforcement"" input dialog, all surfaces that connect to the nodes selected for the design are displayed. For example, in the case of a punching analysis at a wall corner, also the surfaces that actually represent the walls. I can also define a longitudinal reinforcement for these surfaces. Is this accounted for in any way? Why do I see these areas in dialog 1.4?","You're right. In the ""1.4 Longitudinal Reinforcement"" input dialog, all surfaces that connect to the node selected for the design are displayed. That means also the walls at the wall corner you mentioned. However, the definition of the position of the longitudinal reinforcement for these walls is not relevant for the punching analysis in the floor slab. As of version 5.19.01 of RFEM, a filter was installed with which only the surfaces can be displayed for which the definition of the position of the longitudinal reinforcement is relevant. You will find the filter button in the input dialog 1.4 at the lower right edge."
I am currently using a trial version and still need various additional modules. Where can I activate and also test them?,"Within the RFEM/RSTAB test version, you automatically have access to all add-on modules. An additional module can be opened either via the data project navigator or via the menu bar. "
Can I locally extrude a line into a face?,You can find this function by right-clicking on Extrude line. You can select local in the detailed settings. This function is explained in the attached video.
RSTAB and RFEM crash immediately when the program is started. I have BitDefender antivirus software installed on my computer. What is the reason?,The problem is caused by an incorrect update of the BitDefender signature database. Update the BitDefender signature database to fix the problem. 
"Why can't I activate the ""Nonlinear time history analysis"" option in the RF-DYNAM Pro add-on module?","The add-on module RF-DYNAM Pro - Nonlinear Time History Analysis is only available for 3D models. So you have to change the model type to ""3D"" in the basic data of the model. "
Is it possible to generally increase the calculated load-bearing capacity of laminated safety glass according to DIN 18008-1 (8.3.9)?,"Yes, in the 1.2 Layers tab it is possible to select the ""Laminated safety glass"" checkbox.As a result, the design value of the load-bearing capacity of the selected material is increased by a flat rate of 10%. "
Why do the results of the line support reactions differ from the surface results?,"The main reason for this is the FE mesh size and the different smoothing of the results. With an increasingly finer FE mesh, the results should converge. The support resultant is 16.84 kN. However, the resultant of the area results is only 14.41 kN. If the FE mesh is refined at this point, the results are aligned. The FE mesh has been further refined. The results now match exactly. The deviation at the beginning can be explained by the singular point and by the smoothing of the internal forces."
How is the calculation of surface models with plastic material carried out?,"Finite elements with plastic material are divided into 10 layers. First, in the first iteration, a completely normal elastic calculation is carried out. Then the stress in each element is calculated according to the set strength hypothesis in each individual layer. If the limit stress is exceeded in one of the layers, then the stiffness of this layer is reduced. An overall stiffness is determined for each element from the reduced stiffness of the 10 layers. A new calculation iteration is started with this new stiffness. Iterates until the changes are small. The total stress is converted into the stresses of the individual layers using the laminate theory . This theory is also used for the conversion between the stiffness of the layers and the overall stiffness. 4 different strength hypotheses can be used as the limit stress:Shape change energy hypothesis (von Mises stress)Shear stress hypothesis (Tresca stress)Failure hypothesis according to Drucker-PragerFailure hypothesis according to Mohr-Coloumb. The von Mises hypothesis is preset because it is the most commonly used strength hypothesis."
According to which theory are the temporary loads and the applied combinations calculated in RF-STAGES or STAGES.,"In RF-STAGES, the temporary loads in the respective construction stage are calculated exclusively linearly, according to the 1st order theory. The permanent loads that are applied to the system are calculated non-linearly according to the III. order theory. The results of the individual load cases are then combined in the combinations that can be generated in the module."
"After importing a .stp file, there is a free node near each bar. Why are these nodes created?","The trigger for this is due to the rotation of a rod. A member rotation can be defined in RFEM and RSTAB using two options: Option 1: Rotation using angleOption 2: Rotation using auxiliary nodes These options can be controlled in the detailed settings for importing the .stp file. If the function is activated, the first option using Angle is used. If this function is deactivated, an auxiliary node is automatically created, which is used to define the member rotation."
How can thermal prestressing be taken into account in the design value of the load-bearing capacity of glass?,"By checking the ""Thermally prestressed"" check box, the prestress can be taken into account when calculating the inertial resistance. If this option is selected, formula (2) (8.3.6 /DIN18008-1:2010-12) is used; otherwise formula (3) applies. When you select the material, a pre-selection is made by default, which can also be customized. "
Can models be exchanged bidirectionally between cadwork and RFEM/RSTAB?,"The models can be exchanged between cadwork and RFEM/RSTAB in four ways or with three file types. Exchange via the COM interface. A plugin is generated in cadwork with which the direct export from RSTAB is enabled.Exchange via the *.stp format as DSTV format. Here the exchange in both directions (bidirectional) is possible. Supports can also be exchanged in both directions. Import of surfaces from cadwork to RFEM.Import of lines from cadwork to RFEM/RSTAB In this Webinar all these exchange opportunities will be shown. Using the Export - Modules - Static system function, you can also use cadwork to create complete static systems that are exported to RFEM/RSTAB. This functionality is constantly being expanded in the program."
Can I transfer the customized display properties from one PC to another?,"Yes, this is possible via the configuration manager. The display properties are part of the currently active configuration. The active configuration is shown in bold type in the configuration manager (Options → Configuration manager). You can easily export the changes to the display properties of this configuration to a file using the two buttons and import them again on another PC. If If you use RSTAB, you will receive a configuration file with the "".rsconfig"" extension when exporting. For RFEM you will receive an "".rfconfig"" file."
Is it possible to change the font size for all display property categories at once?,"No, unfortunately it is not possible to change the display properties for several categories (e.g. the text size for the load values of all load types) at once. This must be set individually for each category (e.g. load type). But once you have set the display properties for a configuration on a PC, you can use the Simply transfer the configuration manager to another PC. See FAQ 2982 via the following link."
Is it possible to change the coefficient kc user-defined?,"In the settings for the standard (DIN 18008), the design factor kc can be user-defined.In Chapter 8.3.6 (DIN18008-1:2010-12), this is given as 1.0, if no other parts of the standard have to be observed.Because chapter 7.2 (DIN18008-2:2010-12) specifically for linearly supported glazing, the coefficient is 1.8 for normal glass and 1.0 for tempered glass specified. "
"I have a foundation that is held in one direction (X or Y direction) by subsequent frost aprons (tie beams). From the determination of internal forces in RFEM, I get horizontal support forces in the X and X directions. This is correct as far as it goes. However, the foundations are supported in the X-direction due to the frost barriers. In RF-/FOUNDATION Pro, can I ""switch off"" or ignore a support reaction from RFEM for the design of the foundation?","Yes, this is possible. You can find the control for this in the design details of the respective design case in RF-/FOUNDATION Pro. On the one hand, you can select the bearing load (Px, Py, Pz, Mx or My), which should not be taken into account in the design. On the other hand, you can also determine whether the forces or moments should only be deactivated for a specific direction or for all directions. It is important here that the deactivation of the bearing load is effective for all checks of the design case. If the bearing load Px is only to be deactivated for the proof of sliding, but not for all other proofs, then you can control this with two design cases."
Did I choose the right FE mesh size?,"Unfortunately, there is no general answer as to whether a system is sufficiently discretised. In general, the specification for the calculation with finite elements is that the calculated deformations and stresses no longer deviate from the analytical solution. The goal is to find the optimal number of FE elements at which the stresses no longer change. The user should therefore make the discretization as fine as necessary and as coarse choose as possible. As a general rule, there should always be at least 3 FE elements across the height for holes or openings in the system. The treatment of singularities on re-entrant corners etc. is explained in the following FAQ . With the insufficient discretization of the system, the images in this article show very well that the geometric indentations of the system are hardly recorded and the system consequently resembles a bending beam approaching. A meaningful dimensioning is therefore not possible."
"Why is it even possible to switch off individual designs in RF-/FOUNDATION Pro? This poses a risk for the user to ""accidentally"" switch off certain proofs and under certain circumstances to design a foundation undersized?","We would like to give the user as much freedom as possible when controlling the designs in RF-/FOUNDATION Pro. By default, the relevant verifications according to EN 1992-1-1 and EN 1997-1 are activated when creating a new case. These can be partially deactivated. On the one hand, if verification is not required due to the structural design of the foundation. On the other hand, for test or verification purposes. However, it should be noted that at least one geotechnical verification according to EN 1997-1 must be activated. "
Some members are not taken into account during load generation. What is the reason?,This is usually due to the fact that the tolerances in the load generation settings were not defined sufficiently. You can quickly identify the members in question because they are not selected by default in the preview of the load plane with the selected members. This is because the members involved are out of plane. Further adjustments are therefore required in the tolerance settings of the distributed load level.
What is set with the definition nodes in the line release dialog?,"A line release automatically generates a new line with new nodes. If you want to use your own nodes as end nodes for the new line, you can enter them here."
In RFEM I have the option to deactivate objects of the structure. Does this option also exist in RSTAB?,"This option is also available for members in RSTAB. This option can be activated in the ""Calculation parameters"" of a load case under ""Modify stiffness"". "
Is it possible to use a single seat dongle (hardlock or softlock) on a virtual machine or via remote desktop?,Unfortunately this is not possible. Both access via remote desktop and the use of virtualization software are intended and will be blocked. The solution to this problem is to use a network dongle. You can also control the license via Remote Desktop and via a VM. Please contact our sales department for information about changing the dongle.
"Can the loads from the casing, e.g. B. from cladding of the rod or generate icing?","Sheathing loads, e.g. B. from ice loads, coatings, etc. can be generated as a member load. The function can be called up in the menu via ""Extras → Generate load → From casing..."". All you have to do is specify the thickness and specific weight of the sheathing."
How is the minimum shear reinforcement according to DIN EN 1992-1-1 determined in RF-PUNCH Pro?,"The minimum shear reinforcement Asw,min is determined in RF-PUNCH Pro using Equation 9.11DE from DIN EN 1992-1-1, 9.4.3. The input values used to determine Asw,min are output in the ""2.2 Required punching shear reinforcement"" results mask in the ""Minimum punching shear reinforcement"" section, so that the calculated value can be understood. It should be noted here that the calculated value Asw,min according to the standard refers to the ""cross-section of a bracket arm (or equivalent)"". In RF-PUNCH Pro, this value is then multiplied by the tangential number of the individual rows of stirrups, whereby the absolute value of the minimum reinforcement [cm²] in the individual perimeters can increase outwards with increasing length of the perimeter or increasing number of stirrup legs. "
"I have problems with the definition of moving loads on continuous members. In the case of continuous members 1 and 2, the initial directions are swapped, although they point in the same direction.","Ultimately, all loads defined in RSMOVE / RF-MOVE refer to members. In the example, for continuous member no. 1, the member orientation is set opposite to the set of members orientation. In set of members no. 2, however, the set of members orientation is the same as the member orientation. Both systems can be adjusted very easily, e.g. B. all members of set of members no. 1 are selected and the member orientation is changed with the function. The moving loads must then be generated again."
How can I display the member direction or member orientation of members in my system?,"The member orientation of the members can be activated in the project navigator - show in the category ""Model--> Members"". Alternatively, you could also display the member orientation using the member axis systems, since the x-axis of the member follows the same orientation."
Is the DICKQ cross-section program only available as a 32-bit version or is there a 64-bit version as well?,"The DICKQ program is only available as a 32-bit version. However, you can also use this on a computer with a 64-bit operating system."
My student version has expired. What should I do to continue using the programs?,"The period of use of the student version is limited to 1 year. However, this can always be extended by another year, whereby a new current certificate of enrollment must be submitted. Please use the following form for the extension: https://www.dlubal.com/de/bildung/studenten/kostenlose-studentenversion-anDemand-or-extend "
Which parameters do I have to fill out and how if I want to apply a temperature bar load via the COM interface?,"To apply a temperature load to a member using the COM interface, simply use a member load with the following parameters: Dim memload As RSTAB8.MemberLoadmemload.Direction = LocalZTypememload.Distribution = UniformTypememload.Magnitude1 = T_cmemload.Magnitude2 = dTmemload .ObjectList = ""1""memload.Type = TemperatureType T_c corresponds to the constant temperature component and dT to that on Ober - and bottom different."
"Depending on the system, the dimensioning in the graphic representation is very confusing in the printout of RX-TIMBER. Can this be optimized?","By default, the graphic is only printed over 40% of the page height in the log. In some cases it makes sense to display the graphic printout over the entire page height and to rotate the graphic by 90°. Normally it should be sufficient to display the dimensions with two decimal places to save space. This setting can be defined in the ""Units and decimal places"" menu. Finally, the auxiliary lines can be shortened and the font size reduced. A font size of 5 should be sufficient for an A4 printout. To choose such a small font size, the font ""Small Fonts"" should be used."
"In RSTAB, how can you select the side on which the release is effective for eccentrically connected members?","In the case of member end hinges whose reference system is defined on the local member axes, the hinge is set directly at the member start or member end. If the joint is to act directly on the node, the reference system must be defined in relation to the global axis system."
How does the static height d result in the bending design of block foundations (calculation as equivalent beam)?,"The static height d for the proof of ""flexural safety of substitute beam"" results from the slab thickness minus the set concrete cover on the underside of the block foundation, the diameter of the regular bending reinforcement of the slab on the underside in both directions and half the diameter of the reinforcement of the ""substitute beam"". The static height d is taken into account differently in both directions (bending around the x and around the y axis). This must be taken into account when evaluating the calculation in the results table ""2.2 Relevant verifications - Bending resistance of replacement beams""."
I want to calculate a bolted connection in RFEM using FEM. Is there an option in the material library to select the material according to the property class of the screw (e.g. 8.8)?,The rigidity of the screw does not depend on the strength class and is 210000 N/mm² for most steels. An S235 can therefore be selected as the material for the screw in order to take the rigidity of the screw into account.
Can orthotropic area loads be defined in RFEM? I would like to load a surface with different temperature loads in each direction., This cannot be implemented in RFEM on the loading side. Possibly the behavior on the structure side can be represented by using orthotropic surfaces.
"I calculate a symmetrical surface model. However, the reported voltages are not consistent. Is it a user error? ","So that the correct stresses are displayed on all surfaces, it is advisable to switch on the local axis system via the project navigator - show the surface axis system. It is usually evident that the respective surfaces have a different rotation of the surface axes than the other surfaces."
"I tried to access the cross section database via the COM interface with the GetDatabaseCrossSection() command. Unfortunately the objects are always empty, what can I do?","The command comes from the newer RS-COM 8 or RF-COM 5 interface, but the cross-section database is only available via the older RS-COM 6 or RF-COM 3 interface. Since you can include both libraries in a project, you can fetch the data via the older interface."

How can I measure a ceiling from the manufacturer Lignotrend?,The structures of the company Lignotrend can best be defined for members under the composite cross-sections. Further information on this can also be found in this Technical article. 
I have modeled a curved line or a circle whose axis system is different over the length or over the circumference. Why is this and how can I unify the local axes?,"Depending on the orientation of the lines/bars in space, the coordinate systems along the line or bar can be different. For a precise definition of alignment, see the link below this FAQ. To unify the coordinate system, the line or bar must have an identical bar rotation. This is only guaranteed for curved objects if they are rotated using an auxiliary node. To do this, select ""Inside"" as the node number. The plane can be specified with the ""xy"" and ""xz"" options."
My model no longer shows arrows for the bearing forces. What could be the cause for this?,"In this case, you should first check the results panel. Sometimes the display factor for the bearing forces is ""0"". Once this is increased, the arrows should reappear. "
The processing time for the models is specified in the project manager. How to reset this processing time?,"The processing time can be deleted in the history of the model. To do this, the relevant model must be selected in the project manager and the ""History"" command selected from the context menu. In the ""History of the model"" window, click on the ""Delete"" button and confirm the entry with ""OK"". In addition to the processing time, the information created on, created by, changed on and changed by is also deleted."
"What do the abbreviations of the design situations in the ""Combination Rules"" tab mean?"," ULS: Ultimate state LSL: Serviceability limit state EQU: Verification of location security; Loss of stability of the structure or one of its parts, e.g. by tipping, floating or lifting STR: Failure of the Structure or individual parts by exceeding the material strength, excessive deformation, reaching a kinematic state or an unstable position GEO: Excessive deformation or failure of the subsoil "
have defined diagrams for bar end hinges. How can I transfer this information to other computers?,"The diagrams are stored in a configuration file. In a standard installation, this file is located in the file pathC:\ProgramData\Dlubal\Global\General Data\ and has the file nameNonLinWorkDiagMembRelease.cfg. Before the configuration file is copied, the RFEM/RSTAB file must be saved and RFEM/RSTAB closed. "
Can additional individual loads for the crane runway girder also be defined in the CRANEWAY add-on module?,"Unfortunately, this is not yet possible. The additional loads can only be taken into account as a uniform load over the entire beam."
"If new versions of RSTAB and RFEM are installed using msiexec, will the old versions be overwritten?","No, the old versions will not be uninstalled. This means that several versions of RSTAB and RFEM can be used on the computer at the same time, which makes sense in many cases.If you want to uninstall an old RSTAB or RFEM version, you can do this with the following Command:msiexec -x <old MSI package>For a complete list of all msiexec capabilities, use the following command:msiexec -h "
Does your student version also offer the interface between Revit and RFEM?,The student version also supports the interface to REVIT.
How can I change the font size in the RSTAB / RFEM tables?,"Various adjustments to the table can be made in the program's menu bar under the entry ""Table--> Settings"". The font and size can also be adjusted as desired."
How can surfaces be connected to other surfaces or members in a pinned/flexible manner?,"Basically, elements in RFEM are rigidly connected to each other. Two elements are suitable in RFEM to solve this bond. The line joints and the line releases. The difference is explained in the link below. "
"When calculating with RF-SOILIN I get the error number 10739 with the message ""The construction is above the ground"". What should I do?","The reason for the error message is the different heights of the soil slabs. The program creates several levels from soil layer to soil layer between the individual soil samples. Due to the different heights of the floor slabs, some surfaces would theoretically hang in the air (thus the error message).There is a function in RF-SOILIN that can describe additional geological regions."
Does the calculation in RF-SOILIN also work with volumes?,"Yes, the calculation also works with solid bodies. The only important thing for the calculation is that the solid must be bedded with one surface side (base plate). This means that it is not possible to support the solid with only line supports for the calculation using RF-SOILIN."
Is the RF-CONCRETE Surfaces module able to determine and output a required reinforcement with the appropriate diameter in the design without direct crack width calculation according to EN 1992-1-1 7.3.3?,"The program can only determine a required longitudinal reinforcement in [cm²/m] using a previously selected diameter. The diameter used as a basis for the bar diameter limitation check is defined in window 1.4 in the ""Longitudinal Reinforcement"" tab. Both a diameter for the basic reinforcement and a diameter can be entered here for the reinforcement in the serviceability limit state. The diameter used for the verification according to 7.3.3 is determined by weighting the two defined diameters. The basis for this is the ratio of the existing basic reinforcement and the additional reinforcement applied for the SLS. "
Why do the serviceability limit state designs in STEEL EC3 differ for a result combination (EK) from load cases (LC) and an OR result combination from load combinations (LC)?,"The deformations in the serviceability limit state analysis in STEEL EC3 are related to the shifted ends of members or sets of members by default. This makes sense because you want to provide proof for the local component. See technical article: https://www.dlubal.com/de/support-und-schulungen/support/knowledge-base/001081 In the case of a result combination of load cases with the form LF1/s + LF11/s or up to LF31, a reference to the deformed system can lead to implausible results. The background is that the values of the shifted bar ends can come from independent load situations and therefore no correct dimension can be determined. The image shows the enveloping deformation of an EK of type (LF1 /s + LF11/s or up to LF31). The deformed bar ends each come from different load cases. This was reproduced here for comparison with LK's. The stitch determined in the middle of the member does not make sense to evaluate. In these cases you should work with load combinations."
"would like to test the ""XY"" module. Can you please send me a trial version?","The additional modules are integrated into the program portfolio of RFEM/RSTAB. This means that if you want to test any module, it is usually sufficient to download the main program hereto download.Only the standalone programs e.g. B. SHAPE-THIN must be downloaded separately. "
Where can I download the DICKQ program as a student version?,"We're sorry, but the program DICKQ is currently not available as a student version available. Your problem may also be solved with the program THINQ solve? This is also available to students free of charge."
A beam is fillet welded to an end plate. How can the weld seam stresses be calculated?,"A rigid beam connection using fillet welds. The carrier profile is an IPE 300, S235. External flange fillet welds (a = 7 mm, l = 150 mm), fillet welds (a = 5 mm, l = 50 mm) along the inside of the flange and double fillet welds (a = 4.5 mm, l = 239 mm) are laid. The connection bending moment is My = -106.11 kNm. It is assumed that the fillet welds are concentrated in the root lines. It follows: A = 2 ∙ 0.7 ∙ 15 + 2 ∙ 0.45 ∙ 23.9 + 4 ∙ 0.5 ∙ 5.0 = 52.51 cm² Iy = 2 ∙ 0.7 ∙ 15 ∙ 15.0² + 2 ∙ 0.45 ∙ 23.9³ / 12 + 4 ∙ 0.5 ∙ 5.0 ∙ (15 - 1.07)² = 7690 cm^4 The following tension results at the end of the double fillet weld: σ⊥ = 10611 / 7690 ∙ 11.95 = 16.49 kN/cm² The fillet welds are modeled in SHAPE-THIN and the internal size is My = -106 .11 kNm entered. After the calculation, the same values result as in the above calculation. "
How long will it take before I can use your programs?,"There is no general answer to this, as experience has shown that every user has a different learning pace. Experience has shown that familiarization with our programs is very quick due to the simple and intuitive usability. The Webinars and Videos , which we offer free of charge on our homepage, make it easier for you to get started quickly with our software."
"Is it possible for me to take account of weakening of the cross-section due to drilling or the like without changing the cross-section, e.g. B. to remodel in the SHAPE-THIN program?","If the holes are subject to a regular grid, they can possibly be defined using the combined cross-sections. Otherwise, there is still the option of reducing the cross-section in the ""Properties"" across the board. This results in a general reduction in the stiffness of the cross-section. Unfortunately, it is not possible to distinguish between compression and tension reductions in the cross-section. This option is only available when remodeling the cross-section in the THIN-THIN program or in some modules of the JOINTS family in the area of the connections."
Can I start the project manager independently of RFEM or RSTAB?,"You can start the project manager via the RX-TIMBER program or via the PRM64.exe. Assuming a standard installation, the exe for RFEM is located at: C:\Program Files\Dlubal\RFEM 5.xx and for RSTAB under: C:\Program Files\Dlubal\RSTAB 8.xx The program RX-TIMBER starts always via the project manager."
How can I realize a screw connection between two surfaces?,"Depending on the requirements, there are a wide variety of variants. As an example, two intersecting U-profiles should serve as surface models The distance between the profiles is made up of half the surface thickness, since mid-surfaces are modeled in RFEM.In variant 1, a screw is modeled between the two surfaces. It should be noted that the load introduction of a single node into a surface forms a singularity. In the appendix you will find a link on how such a punctiform load application can be suppressed or how a bearing bearing can be modeled. With this simpler option, the screw must also absorb compressive forces, since the surfaces do not bear on each other.Variant 2 also uses a contact volume (see link for description). The contact volume can be used to set how power transmission takes place. If the contact volume fails in tension, the screw will bear in tension and the faces in compression."
"entered an overhead crane in KRANBAHN. The buffers cannot be disabled, what can I do?","When defining the beam geometry in window 1.2, the ""Vertical stiffeners at end of beam"" option is activated by default in the ""Stiffeners"" tab. Proceed as follows: In mask 1.2, open the ""Stiffeners"" tab and deactivate the optionNow in the ""Support"" tab you can Deactivate the stiffeners in column KIn window 1.4 ""Load"" the girder buffers can now be deactivated Now the suspension crane can move beyond the ends of the girder."
Why are some external pressure coefficients displayed as 0 when generating the wind load?,"For gable roofs with a roof pitch >5°, the roof areas F, G, H, I and J must be divided according to the windward and leeward sides. For an inflow direction of 0° (wind on the long side), both positive and negative aerodynamic coefficients must be taken into account for roof pitches of up to 45°.For these cases, this results in a total of 4 possible wind combinations for each side of the building considered. For the direction of flow of 90° (wind on the gable end), on the other hand, there are no positive external pressure coefficients. For a building with a roof pitch of 45°, there would be 10 possible wind load cases (0° = 4 2; 90° = 1 2). LF w+: Only positive (pressure) aerodynamic coefficients per roof area are used. LF w-: Only negative (suction) aerodynamic coefficients per roof area are used. LF w-/+: Negative (so-called ) aerodynamic coefficients for the windward side and positive (pressure) coefficients for the leeward side of the roof are used. LF w+/-: Positive (pressure) aerodynamic coefficients are used for the windward side and negative (suction) coefficients for the leeward side of the roof. Is there now for a load position e.g. B. only negative coefficients, then only negative loads are applied to the roof area. There is therefore no pressure --> therefore these values are set to 0. A load case, which therefore only contains values with the size 0, could also be deselected during generation. This is e.g. B. as already described always for the LF w+ with a wind flow direction of 90° (gable end wind) and a roof pitch of > 15° possible."
How can you enter in FE-BUCKLING for the calculation of the reduction factor for shear buckling whether the support stiffener is rigid or deformable?,"In the details, FE-BUCKLING offers the choice between a rigid and a deformable support stiffener for determining the reduction factor for shear buckling."
"After breaking some members into surfaces, I can no longer adaptively mesh the model. ","One reason for the error message can be that embedded members have been broken down into surfaces. These bars are then converted to null bars. However, the member bedding is retained and is still assigned to the zero members. An adaptive mesh refinement can then often no longer be carried out. It is therefore advisable to first remove the bar bedding on the affected bars. "
"Authorization of the program failed. The diagnostic file shows the error ""Error 0x1772 (6002): Specified License Manager could not be found"". What is the reason?","Please open Services under Control Panel -> Administration and verify that the Sentinel LDK License Manager service is started. If necessary, restart the service. Please also set the start type ""Automatic"" for this service. If this does not solve the problem, the problem is probably caused by the dongle driver. Please install it again. The installation is described in the following FAQ: https: //www.dlubal.com/de/support-und-schulungen/support/faq/002235"
How does the fire protection design according to EC 3 work with the add-on module STAHL EC3?,"In order to carry out a fire protection analysis in STEEL EC3, you must select a load case or a load combination in the ""Fire Protection"" tab in window 1.1 for which the fire protection analysis is to be carried out. As soon as you have selected a load for the fire protection analysis, an additional mask ""Fire protection - Members"" or ""Fire protection - Sets of members"" (if sets of members are to be designed in the module case) appears on the left in the module navigator. In this mask 1.10 or 1.11, further settings for the fire protection analysis of the component can be made. by pressing the [Details...] button and selecting the ""Fire protection"" tab. More information on this can also be found in the STAHL EC3 manual."
Are the models and presentations shown from the Info Day 2019 freely available and can you please send them to me?,"Yes, the data is freely available.  With the following download option you can load the presentations and finished models of the speakers. "
Can network licenses also be distributed via Dropbox?,"No, it is not possible to distribute network licenses via Dropbox. For the management of network licenses it is necessary that a server service that can be accessed via the network is running. This service can run on a special server or on a normal workstation computer. However, the workstation computer would then always have to be switched on if users in the network want to access Dlubal licenses."
How can I import the authorization file (AUTHOR.INI) into an RX-TIMBER module?,"Reading in takes place directly in one of the additional modules and not via the project manager. Please start one of the licensed modules and select the ""Read authorization file..."" option in the ""Help"" menu item. Enter the path to which you copied the authorization file and complete the process. Should there also be a problem with the licensing, please send us the diagnosis file of the authorization to. You can have this created in the menu item ""Help → System diagnostics""."
How can I automatically combine my load cases for a road bridge permit?,"You could, for example, use the standard EN 1990 + EN1991-2; Use road bridges. Alternatively, the combinations could of course also be determined manually. Further information can be found in our manual."
Where are the limit parameters user-defined in RF-LIMITS saved so that I can save them?,"The user-defined limit parameters are saved in the ""Limits_User.db3"" file."
How can I change the permissible thickness ranges in RF-/ALUMINUM or RF-/STEEL EC3 for a material?,"The limits cannot be modified in the additional modules mentioned. However, you can create a new material with modified borders based on the desired material. The mask of the material library. Select a suitable base material here and then click on ""Create new material..."". In the following dialog you can give the material a new name and change all of the material's parameters."
"If I create an image for the time course in DYNAM Pro and add it to the printout report via the clipboard, this image appears very blurred. What can I do about it?","In this case, you have the option of printing the image in the time course diagram directly in the printout report. Proceed as described in the picture."
"After the calculation, I get a notice about a large deformation. Why can't I find this deformation in the output?","If you define line loads on a line that is decoupled from the overall system, this line becomes compliant. The program checks this erroneous entry and gives a hint. However, there are structures where this line is held at another point. In this case, the program continues to calculate after the user has confirmed the hint. However, since the deformation for such a decoupled line is very large, it is not displayed in the graphical output. We generally recommend lines that have a line release or line joint. The theoretical background is explained in this Technical article explained."
would like to export a result using isolines or isosurfaces and import it again at a later point in time. Is that possible?,"Yes that works. You have to display the corresponding graphic and activate the export function. To do this, first select the format ASCII format - results. The ""Results - Isolines/Isosurfaces (.dxf)"" tab can be used to select the respective elements to be exported. Using the program's import function, this dxf file can then be imported, e.g. B. as a background layer in an existing model. "
How can I understand the detailed results or the intermediate results of the serviceability limit state design in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces? The info button for the SLS is inactive for the required reinforcement.,"The detailed design details can be called up under the individual verifications under the heading Serviceability. To do this, the line with the corresponding proof must be selected and then the info button pressed. The check can also be selected in the design details in the lower area of the dialog."
Can I enter maximum internal forces for line approvals in RF-LIMITS?,"Unfortunately, this option is not yet available. However, the line release can also be evaluated directly via RFEM. With this method, no utilization is displayed. However, it is suitable for evaluating the forces that are transmitted.The resultants for the results of line hinges and line releases can be displayed using the results navigator under the ""Releases"" entry. A route-related evaluation or the consideration of the total value is possible."
"Why is the method: ""By considering the deformation ratio of the longitudinal reinforcement"" in the detail settings for the SLS in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces inactive?",This calculation method is available for 2D positions
"Is it possible to select ""members"" and transfer the geometry as a buckling panel and its internal forces to the module?","Yes, that is possible. If the add-on module FE-BUCKLING is not opened as a stand-alone variant, but via RSTAB or RFEM, the buckling panels (c/t parts of a member cross-section) and the respective load cases in FE-BUCKLING of the RSTAB or RFEM model can be read in."
Are there no more 32-bit versions of RSTAB and RFEM? ,"The current versions of RFEM and RSTAB are only offered as 64-bit versions. We recommend using the 64-bit version of Windows. This should be possible without any problems. If you still want to use a 32-bit version of RSTAB or RFEM, you can download older versions via these two links: http://extranet.dlubal.com/?file=RFEM5.07.11_32bit.exe http://extranet.dlubal.com/?file=RSTAB8.07.11_32bit .exe"
How can we see the RF-LAMINATE database? We would like to check these for the current status.,"The easiest way is to start RFEM or the add-on module RF-LAMINATE and create at least one surface and at least one load case. After you have selected the surface and defined the load case for design, open the manufacturer library. There you can then choose a structure. You can then check the material properties and strength. There is already an interesting webinar on the subject Design of cross laminated timber panels in RF-LAMINATE on our website."
Why do the results of members and sets of members differ in the design?,"This is because the effective lengths or buckling lengths of members and sets of members are different. While the actual length is used for the stability analysis for the members, it is the length of the combined members for the sets of members.ExampleThe frame consists of a bar, divided into four bars of equal length. In addition, a set of members is created for the four members. In both cases, the proof of stability is based on the equivalent member method.When dimensioning the members, a length of 1.00 m is used for calculation. In contrast, the set of members has a length of 4.00 m. Of course, this difference in length has an effect on the stability design, so that the utilizations also differ.It is also not advisable to calculate all members and sets of members in a single design case, as this will lead to falsified results leads. "
What is the fastest way to generate generated loads for multiple load cases without having to re-enter the boundary points each time? ,"The most convenient and fastest solution is to copy one load case to the next load case. If loads for several load areas have already been generated in a load case, then all loads are transferred to the next load case when copying. Then only the load values of the generated loads have to be adapted to the respective load case. This method is particularly useful for level structures whose type of load remains the same."
"Is it possible to generate a ""response spectrum according to the standard"" with user-defined parameters in the RF-DYNAM Pro module?","Yes there is a possibility. We have implemented this option in many standards. Here you can select the ""Other"" option as the subsoil class and thus adjust some parameters according to your wishes. This option is available in the following annexes of EN 1998-1: CEN, NBN, CSN, DIN, UNI, NP, STN, CYS, BS, NS and NF. "
Is there any way in the program to get normal forces and moments from the calculated stresses for solids?,"We do not provide any internal forces in the program for volumes. The conversion of the stresses into internal forces would also be very complex, since not only mx, my and mz would be available, but also the torsional components, mxy, myz, mxz, as well as lateral and normal forces. In the case of volume, one is usually limited to a direct voltage evaluation. If you still need internal forces, you have the option of relating the internal forces of the volume to a member. For this purpose, the result bar was implemented in the program. "
"After updating to the current version, I get the message that areas are excluded from the design. Several materials are shown in red. Why is that?","Probably a material was defined in RFEM whose standard does not match the design standard (e.g. a material according to DIN 1045-1 was selected, but the design is carried out according to DIN EN 1992-1- 1). The different material standards often use different parameters.It is therefore preferable to select the material standard that also applies to the design standard in RFEM."
"When calculating a temperature load case, I get the error message 10419 ""The temperature load has no effect"". What should I do?","The coefficient of thermal expansion for the material is probably zero. As soon as you change this back to a realistic value, the warning should no longer appear."
Is it possible to display the average of line support results?,"The various options can be controlled using the ""Show"" navigator. Under the ""Results"" category, you can choose between ""Actual"" and ""Real"" for the bearing reactions switch to ""smooth distribution"". The variants ""Constant (average)"" and ""Linear"" are available for this. By the way, a smoothing line can also be displayed when displaying the result curves. "
Can a single-user USB dongle be operated on a dongle server?,"Dongle servers are not supported for local dongles from our dongle manufacturer (Gemalto). We can therefore not guarantee functionality or support when using a dongle server. If a license is to be accessed from several computers, a network dongle is required. Contact our sales department for this."
Can I also determine the stiffness of an existing support instead of a fixed nodal support?,"Yes, it works. For this, you need to activate the elastic support in the ""Edit nodal support"" mask. Based on a few input parameters such as the type of support, support shape, material and support height, the springs of the support are determined by the program. Another advantage in addition to the elastic support is that the area of the column cross-section is turned off in the result output. This hides the singularity points and the concrete design uses the internal forces."
Can RF-TENDON also be used to design surfaces?,"The RF-TENDON module is designed as a design module for members. However, it is also possible to provide surfaces with tendons and to design them using the member type Result beam. An example of the design of a slab is shown in the following webinar:Prestressed concrete design in RFEM "
I would like to download the RFEM and RSTAB installation packages. But the download keeps crashing. Is the Dlubal web server broken?,"All download links on our server are fine. However, the installations are very large files. They are significantly larger than 1 GB. Your network may have a download size limit or there is a problem with your internet connection. Please contact us therefore contact your administrator. If the problem cannot be solved in this way, there is also the option of sending you the current version on a USB stick by post. In this case, contact support by email (support@dlubal.com)."
How can RF-TENDON and RF-TENDON Design be opened?,"The RF-TENDON module can be opened via the menu bar under Additional Modules → RF-TENDON. The RF-TENDON module, which is used for the subsequent cross-section design, can be opened from within RF-TENDON. The modules are only available in RFEM . Both modules are also available in the student version. "
Can I insert a 3D graphic into the RSTAB / RFEM model?,"3d objects in the ""3ds"" format can be easily loaded into the existing model in the program via Insert → visual objects. The scale, the insertion point and the rotation angle can be set in the ""new visual object"" mask."
"Does RSTAB / RFEM have a function that can determine the maximum internal forces from the various load case combinations, a type of envelope curve?","You can do exactly this very quickly with a result combination. If you add the individual load cases, load combinations or result combinations to this with the ""Or"" criterion, the maximum or minimum results are calculated from these, i.e. the envelope, so to speak. For more information on using result combinations, see our manual, among others."
Why do the results of a result combination from load cases differ from the LC formed from load combinations?,"When creating a load combination, the ""2nd order"" calculation type is preset by default in the calculation parameters. In the case of linear systems that are statically indeterminate, the results for load cases that are calculated according to the standard first-order theory can therefore differ."
Can I have my model saved automatically after the calculation? ,"That's fine. To do this, call up the program options under Options and tick ""Save after calculation"". The model is saved automatically after each calculation run. This option is particularly useful for larger structures that take a long time to be calculated."
"I get the expression ""-1.#J"" for the rigid as well as the hinged limit stiffness. What should I do?","The limiting stiffnesses for rigid or articulated connections can be determined according to EN 1993-1-8 5.2.2.5 (1). The area moment of inertia of the ledger, the span, the modulus of elasticity and the reinforcement of the frame are included in the calculation. As of version 5.19.01, this information can be defined in more detail in Table 1.4 under ""Classification"". Since this information was not available in earlier versions, but is now queried by the calculation core, you get this expression ""-1.#J"". Mask 1.4 should be called up to remedy this. The modulus of elasticity, length and moment of inertia of the bolt are read out automatically. If there are bar divisions in the bar, the length may have to be adjusted. The type of bracing must also be specified by the user. A stiffened system (Kb=8) is assumed by default. After recalculating the module, the correct limit stiffnesses are calculated."
"want to edit a model, e.g. add nodal supports or change members and I get warning number 1145. What can I do?","The reason for this message is that you are in viewer mode. When installing RFEM or RSTAB, a viewer version is automatically installed in addition to the normal version. This appears as an additional icon on the desktop. In this mode, files with results can be opened, but no changes can be made. If you want to edit and calculate a file, you should open the icon without the addition ""Viewer"". "
get the following error message. Error #30426 - Error #1 Model is not stored!What's the problem? ,"Please define bearings in the model that absorb the loads, otherwise no calculation is possible. In RSTAB, for example, you can provide nodal supports, in RFEM nodal, line, and surface supports."
"For a cross-section in my model, the STEEL EC3 add-on module uses the wrong yield point depending on the component thickness. What can be the cause?","This effect usually occurs with SHAPE-THIN cross-sections. When modeling the cross-sections, care should always be taken to ensure that the entries for height and thickness are not mixed up for the elements."
What information is transferred when exporting the nonlinear stiffness? Is it possible to display the exported values graphically?,"When exporting the nonlinear stiffness from the RF-CONCRETE Members module or the RF-CONCRETE Surfaces module, only the stiffness values are exported. The following results or effects are not exported: Shrinkage: The influence of shrinkage is not exported directly, since shrinkage is taken into account from the load side and not from the stiffness side. If there is a change in rigidity (tearing) when considering shrinkage, this effect is of course also exported. Results from the NL calculation: Other results from the non-linear calculation, such as crack width or steel and concrete stress, are not exported.Currently, it is not possible to graphically display the exported stiffness in RFEM."
"Can I hide the text of the standards for the material designation, i.e. a short form?","If the colors are defined in the display navigator according to the ""Material"" setting, then the full material designation is displayed in the panel by default, ie material name + standard. The full material designation is also displayed in the tables (Table 1.3) of RSTAB and RFEM, among others. If you only want the material designations in the panel and tables, you can In the ""Program Options"" dialog, deactivate the full material designation."
Where is the consequential damage class defined in RX wood?,The consequential damage class can be set in the RF Combi module. The desired setting can be made in the coefficients. 
"want the rebar results (As,-z (top), As,+z (bottom), asw,V,stirrup ) for a beam from my RFEM or RSTAB file and read it into AutoCAD. With the dialog ""Export"" → ""DXF"" I can only read out the geometry. Is there a possibility?","Unfortunately, there is currently no way to export reinforcement from RF-/CONCRETE Members to a CAD format. In RFEM, however, the design results from RF-CONCRETE surfaces can be exported to a DXF file. "
"I want to design a stair railing for which I have created a set of bars. The profile is a hollow profile. Can the stability verification be carried out for the entire system or do I have to transfer this to an equivalent member verification, specifying all bearings in STEEL EC3?","For a warp-free cross-section, a verification of the entire system using the second-order theory - internal forces and local and global imperfections is recommended. The input of the effective lengths and nodal supports (for sets of members) can thus be omitted. However, please activate gamma_M1 for the cross-section design."
In TIMBER Pro I cannot calculate any members with double rectangular cross-sections and linearly variable cross-section heights. What is the reason?,"In the RF-/TIMBER Pro module, double rectangular cross-sections (""H-2B"" cross-section) can only be designed with a constant cross-section height over the member length. H-2B cross-sections with a haunch are excluded from the design.In this case, it is advisable to represent the H-2B cross-section with two separate rectangular cross-sections. Either you model the two bars geometrically separately from each other and couple them, e.g. B. with rigid members, or you activate the option ""Allow double members"" in the ""Edit"" menu and assign appropriate eccentricities to the two members that are initially on top of each other. These members can then be designed in RF-/TIMBER Pro.A sample file is available below under ""Downloads""."
Is it also possible to display the FE mesh on the deformed system?,"Yes, it works. To do this, you have to activate the item ""At surface results"" in the project navigator - Show under ""FE mesh""."
"I get an error message when using nonlinear material, what should I do?","With RF-MAT NL we offer the use of various nonlinear material models. If you combine members, surfaces and/or volumes in RFEM, the nonlinear material models must be assigned individually for members (1D) and surfaces and volumes (2D / 3D). Members as 1D elements cannot be nonlinear Material model (2D/3D) assigned."
I need to size a wall bracket (steel brackets). I modeled it as surface components in RFEM. The question: With which module can these steel brackets be calculated?,"For the design of steel surfaces, please use the RF-STEEL Surfaces module of the same name. If you also want to take local buckling into account, then the add-on modules RF-STABILITY (to determine the buckling shape and critical loads) and RF-IMP (to determine the imperfection shape based on the buckling shape) are recommended."
My project manager no longer shows miniature models. I can't dock a button for it either. What should I do?,Sometimes it can happen that the info window has been moved all the way down. You can move it up again by holding down the left mouse button.
I would like to take part in a Dlubal webinar for the first time. What do I have to consider after I have registered?,"After you have registered, you will receive a confirmation email with a link that allows you to participate in the webinar free of charge. Please open this link a few minutes before the start of the webinar and follow the further instructions.To participate in the webinar you need a computer with internet access as well as speakers, headphones, a headset or similar to hear the sound . Alternatively, you can also receive the sound via a telephone (normal landline costs). Your microphone is muted during the webinar. However, you can ask questions via chat."
"The modulus of elasticity is reduced for the hot rating. I assume that applies first to the evidence. However, to what extent is a change in stiffness in the structure and thus a redistribution of the load taken into account?","The modulus of elasticity of the material is reduced for the verifications according to EC 3, but not for the internal forces, since this is not intended according to the method of DIN EN 1993-1-2. The cold state of the structure is always assumed. When calculating the internal forces, you only have to take into account the internal constraint from temperature stress, if it exists. "
How can I take a sling assembly into account in KRANBAHN?,"Entering a rolling bond as a construction is currently not possible in KRANBAHN. However, in RSTAB or RFEM you can determine the equivalent spring, which can then be considered as lateral support in CRANEWAY. To do this, proceed as follows: Model the coil brace in RSTAB or RFEMSet the at the point of the lateral support Unit load 1kNCalculate the nodal deformation in global Y for each position of the lateral support.Calculate the equivalent spring from the determined deformation and the load. (see picture)Note: This method is not recommended in the technical literature. The background is that the spring stiffnesses change for each wheel position and the normal force load on the crane runway girder in its capacity as a truss chord is not taken into account in the design. "
"The RF-/DYNAM Pro add-on module has the parameters 'Modal mass', 'Participation factor' and 'Equivalent mass'. The manual does have the formulas, but an explanation and how to use them would be helpful.","Modal mass Every multi-mass system can usually be represented by a one-mass system. When performing this transformation, one needs the modal mass of the system. This mass is required to generate the frequency of the equivalent single-mass oscillator.Participation factor This factor can also be negative, since it consists of the equivalent mass at a node and the associated deflection due to the natural mode. If the deflection is in the negative direction, the participation factor becomes negative. The equivalent mass factor is still positive because the participation factor is squared (see formula).Equivalent mass The equivalent mass of a system is part of the total mass, which due to the vibration of the Multi-mass oscillator is excited. The equivalent mass of a system can be between zero and the total mass. The equivalent mass factor is only the quotient of the total mass and the equivalent mass. This means that you can usually check more quickly how large the proportion of the excited mass is in the respective eigenmode. If it happens that the equivalent mass factor is greater than 1, you should check the discretization of the system and, if necessary, refine the division of the nodes or the FE mesh.The equivalent mass factor is usually used for an earthquake analysis and the equivalent mass are decisive, since the dynamic equivalent loads on the building are calculated with these values."
Can you design timber-timber connections according to EN 1995-1-1 Chapter 8.2.2 in RSTAB and RFEM with the additional module Joints? ,"The design of timber connections with pin-shaped fasteners is currently limited to steel-timber connections according to Chapter 8.2.3. Pure wood-wood connections based on shearing, taking into account the Johansen theory, are therefore currently not possible. Direct wood-to-wood connections using full-thread screws are possible with the module RF-/JOINTS wood - wood to wood, with which main-secondary beam connections can be calculated."
"The calculation in RFEM takes a long time. However, the utilization of the processor is low. How can this be accelerated?","Please check if the iterative solver is set. If this is the case, then set the direct solver.Open the calculation parameters (Calculation menu > Calculation parameters) and check whether the direct solver is set."
Is it possible to use your own materials as a basis in RSTAB or RFEM in the add-on module “Concrete Reinforced Concrete Design”?,"Yes, this is possible, but this custom material must be created via the material library in the appropriate filter so that all information relevant to the module is available. In addition, the code group or code must be selected so that it matches the design code in the module. It is best to go to the material library and select the material category and group there , as well as the corresponding standard. After selection, create a new material Then a corresponding dialog opens in which you can select a material designation and the corresponding parameters. The material should then be usable in the design."
What is the recommended target length of the finite elements?,"Depending on the individual dimensions of the system, the following rule is recommended:Generation of eight to ten elements between the border lines of an area, but at least four elements More elements are also possible, whereby it should be noted that a FE mesh width that is too fine delays the calculation unnecessarily and at the same time the quality of the results is not necessarily improved. Local may be recommended FE mesh refinements.The FE mesh settings can be made under ""Calculation"" → ""FE mesh settings"". "
Are the Dlubal webinars recorded and uploaded to YouTube?,"We record all our webinars and then post them free of charge on our website and YouTube available. You can also find the presentation slides, model files, etc. used on our website."
"For the interpretation and documentation of the results, I would like to have the vertical line support results clearly displayed in the top view.Which setting should be selected for this?","In the Show navigator in the Results section --> Support reactions, the ""Draw in XY plane"" option can be activated "
"During the stability analysis in RSBUCK I get the following error message: ""The model is not connected because there are independent submodels."" What does that mean and what can I do about it?","Independent sub-models are not connected to each other and are considered as separate sub-models in the calculation. They are therefore independent models without influencing each other. It is advisable to edit partial models separately as individual files. After that, a stability analysis with RSBUCK is possible. Otherwise, the partial models must be connected to each other. It should be noted that when the sub-models are merged into an overall model, the static systems of the sub-models should be retained. Helpful with recognition of partial models is the ""Independent Systems"" function. This finds all independent systems and lists them as groups. You can find this function under Extras -> Model Control -> Independent systems."
"How can I delete all objects that belong together, e.g. E.g. select simultaneously in a set of members?",The easiest way to do this is to use the Related Objects feature. This can be found in the menu under Edit-->Select.
Is it possible to output the loads of the edge seal of an insulating glass pane?,"Unfortunately, it is not possible to output the stresses of the edge seal of an insulating glass pane in tabular or graphic form in the module. An alternative way of determining the forces would be, for example, to evaluate the bearing reactions.If both panes are stored, the associated force can be determined from this. "
Which stiffnesses does RFEM use for orthotropic hollow core slabs with rectangular cavities?,"The determination of the stiffness can be found in a PDF file, which you can download below in the ""Downloads"" area. The output variable is the corresponding I cross-section."
How to change the value of the gravitational acceleration?,"The gravitational acceleration can be changed in the ""Options"" tab of the basic model data."
"I purchased the RF-MAT NL add-on module, but I can't find it anywhere.",The add-on module RF-MAT NL is already integrated in RFEM 5. It is assumed that the following material models can be used: Isotropic plastic 1DIsotropic plastic 2D/3DIsotropic nonlinear elastic 1D Isotropic nonlinear elastic 2D/3D Orthotropic plastic 2DOrthotropic plastic 3D Isotropic masonry 2D Isotropic damage 2D/3D

I want to calculate a truss hanging from a crane. Why does the program always show me an instability when calculating?,"With a normal suspension on a crane hook or on a traverse, the component will be able to move away under external horizontal loads. In the same way, the suspension on the crane will not represent any support for the internal forces occurring in the system.The depiction of systems that are actually unstable because they are mobile in a calculation program is not always easy. You should unlock the bearings on the crane lugs for X and Y (horizontal) and consider how horizontal forces that arise from an uneven vertical load (= torsion) can be absorbed. This can usually be done But calculate the model if you store the traverse horizontally with a very small spring (see model file)."
"RF-/STEEL EC 3 does not perform a stability analysis with torsion. The verification with the warping torsion analysis is independent of that, isn't it?","That is correct. For the verification of the relevant components, these must be defined as sets of members and selected for the design.It is also important that in the design case of the warping analysis no members are selected for the design that are either already contained in the sets of members or on are subjected to torsion, since the RF-/STEEL EC3 module then wants to design them using the equivalent member method and it may not be possible to design them due to the torsion. Then a warning would appear."
"How does RF-/STEEL EC3 design class 4 cross-sections? Is the existing load taken into account in the statement ""Class 4""?",RF-/STEEL EC3 designs class 4 cross-sections using the effective width method according to EN 1993-1-5. The existing voltage is taken into account here.
"When entering the members, I worked with double members. Is there anything else that needs to be taken into account, or is it better to enter a member with double cross-section values?","You can use the combined cross-sections of the cross-section library to check multi-part components. Here, the cross-section values are automatically calculated from the individual cross-sections and then also taken into account in the additional modules for the design. The shear-flexible connection of lattice members is shown here by entering an equivalent plate thickness t*. If you use the "" Modify Stiffnesses"", these are generally not used in the design modules. The modified stiffnesses are only used in the calculation of internal forces. You need the designs in RF-/STEEL EC3 For example, for the c/t proof or the choice of the interaction equation, the exact dimensions and the shape of the cross section. The effect of the stiffness modification on these individual parameters is not clear in all cases and can therefore not be used in the add-on module. "
What do the abbreviations mean for the crane loads in the CRANE RAILWAY add-on module?,"Vertical wheel loads QC (proportion due to the crane's own weight) QH (proportion due to lifting load) Horizontal wheel loads H T (proportion due to starting/braking of the crane bridge) HS (proportion of skew forces due to starting/braking of a crane) HT3 (proportion due to starting/braking of trolley or hoist) longitudinal loads HL (Part due to starting/braking of a crane) If there is an additional skew force (S) or a buffer force (HB) effective, it can be specified below the table. There is already an interesting webinar on the topic ""Measurement of crane runway girders according to Eurocode 3"" on our homepage."
"In a calculation I have activated the ""detailed calculation"" option. Are the bearing loads already specified with the reduced vibration coefficient for dimensioning the substructure?","Like the internal forces, the bearing forces from the load cases are combined taking into account the vibration coefficients. To do this, the bearing forces (except for LF1 and LF2) are multiplied by the ratio of the dynamic coefficient carrier to the dynamic coefficient bearing and added according to the LK criterion, since the wheel loads from LF3 already include the dynamic coefficient for the carrier. With the Only max/min option, only the extreme values of the support forces for the correspondingdirections are output, ie the characteristic support forces multiplied by the associatedVibration coefficient for supports (see picture). There is already an interesting webinar on the topic ""Dimensioning of crane runway girders according to Eurocode 3"" on our homepage."
Can RSTAB and RFEM be operated on a terminal server?,The installation of RSTAB and RFEM on a terminal server is possible. A network license is required. 
Why does RFEM not find equilibrium for a load directed upwards on a membrane roof that is curved downwards?,"The downwardly curved, synclastic roof geometry reacts numerically stable for downward loads. Loads in the direction of the arch ultimately increase the tensile load in the membrane and thus stabilize the system. Loads against the arch shape of the roof reduce the tensile load in the membrane. In this case, if the membrane tensile load approaches zero, numerical difficulties arise due to the sole membrane tensile strength of the element used. In this case, the solution process reacts with poor convergence, instability messages or messages for a positive definite Jacobian matrix. "
"In my model, the sum of the support forces deviates from the internal forces in the result beam. What can be the reason?","Especially if you have modeled walls using surfaces, there may be a deviation between the sum of the support forces and the shear forces in the result member. This is because the surface internal forces are integrated to member section sizes. Depending on the size of the FE mesh, the results may be incorrect or inaccurate. You can use the following procedure to improve the results: Reduce the size of the FE mesh. The deviations between the support forces and the shear forces should then approach 0.Increase the division for result curves in the calculation parameters. This also leads to an approximation of the results. In the result curves there is the possibility to to display a smoothing line that smears the internal forces of the result bar over the entire length. In the example file, the results were shown once for a FE - Net length of 1 m, a length of 0.25 m and a pitch of 100 calculated. The total load is 885.3 kN. "
"When verifying a hinged beam connection with JOINTS, the verification of the premature seam failure on the fin plate is decisive. What exactly does the verification of the premature seam failure take into account and does it have to be carried out in every case?","This proof or this check is carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the ECCS.It requires that the weld seam must not be decisive for the load-bearing capacity of the connection. The load-bearing capacity of the weld seam must therefore be > the load-bearing capacity of the fin plate. If this check is not complied with, either the weld seam thickness can be increased or the thickness of the fin plate can be reduced.The minimum thickness of the weld seam with which the requirement is met is output in the verification details."
Could it be that the formula editor has a problem with units in combination with dimensionless parameters?,"Special attention must be paid to the syntax when using formulas with units and unitless values. If no brackets are used, a space must be inserted between the unit and the operator. "
I would like to perform a hot design with the EC3 module. Is it possible to intervene in the program so that I can use my own temperature curves instead of the standard ones?,"The procedure according to EC 3 can only be used for the temperature curves from EN 1990-1-2. With the simplified calculation of the steel temperature in EC 3-1-2, it is also only possible to take into account rising temperature profiles; a drop in temperature is not available in this simplified calculation. However, it is also possible to use direct steel temperatures in the program. "
Is it possible to change the relation of the deformation results to a user-defined coordinate system?,"No, this possibility does not exist. Node deformations are always output in relation to the global coordinate system, regardless of whether the structure was entered using a user-defined coordinate system.If necessary, the output of the local member or surface deformation results can help. "
"When installing RSTAB / RFEM, the material library was not installed or was not installed in the correct location. Error number 1158 appears. I cannot find the Materials.dbd file. Where can I find the file?","The 1. Possibility is a new installation of the program. The first time you try to install the program again, you will be asked whether you want to uninstall it first. Confirm the query and then reinstall the program. The 2. Possibility is the manual integration of existing material libraries from another computer on which the programs are already installed. The following material databases must be synchronized in each program version:The material library ""Materialien.dbd"" installed by the program with the common materialsThe user-defined material library ""Materialien_User.dbd "" By default, these databases are located in the hidden folder C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\RFEM\General Data Under the download links you will also find the material databases for the versions RFEM 5.18 and RSTAB 8.18"
"RSTAB does not yet use multiple cores to the same extent as is the case with RFEM. Is an optimization for multi-core processors also planned for RSTAB, as this significantly influences the choice of processor?","RSTAB already uses the advantages of parallelization. Basically, the parallelization of RSTAB 8 and RFEM 5 can be summarized as follows:Parallelization of program parts in RSTAB 8 and RFEM 5 (except calculation)Priority the advantages of parallelization in the printout report are used. Specifically, browsing the printout log (i.e., retrieving the table of contents) is done with multiple cores.For future versions, it is planned to use parallelization more frequently. For example, the printout report should be created almost exclusively in parallel.There are two different ways of using multiple cores:Inner parallelizationThe parts of a program process are executed simultaneously in multiple threads. It is recommended to only use physical cores, not logical (virtual) ones. Experiences with scientific and technical calculations have shown that parallelization has an advantage of about three and a half times the speed-up, regardless of the number of cores. Some processes, such as the iterative solver, are not suitable for such parallelization.Outer parallelizationIndividual calculations are executed in individual threads. For example, four solvers can be executed in four threads to calculate four different load combinations.RSTAB 8Currently, these two types of parallelization in RSTAB not used yet. However, it is planned to use the outer parallelization with RSTAB in the future.RFEM 5In RFEM 5, the inner parallelization is already used in some program parts . These are, for example, the compilation of the local stiffness matrix and the direct equation solver.The program part called ""FemBase"" is massively parallelized: It calculates the result combinations and returns all results to the graphics, tables and respective sections. It can read the result of three load cases in three threads and, for example, calculate the result combination in the fourth thread.But the outer parallelization has not yet been used. However, work is already underway."
What is the easiest way to model a cushion for the RF-FORM-FINDING add-on module?,"Basically, RFEM does not accept identical surfaces in the same place due to ambiguity. In this case, RFEM automatically deletes one of the two surfaces. Nevertheless, you can create a pillow with form-finding in RFEM. You only have to make sure that the areas are not in the same place in the 1st input. It is therefore recommended to define the surfaces of the pillow with a Bezier surface and to push the inner control points slightly outwards. "
I can't use object snaps to select the intersections of lines on a background layer. What could be the cause for this?,"If you are unable to snap any points on the background layer, you should verify that the object snap settings are correct. If all other points are detected by the object snap, the problem is already there Import the background slide. If 2 lines do not lie exactly in one plane, even if these planes have only an infinitesimally small distance, no node will be formed during import. This point of intersection cannot be chosen. So you should solve this problem directly in your DXF file. "
"Why does the calculation take so long after changing surface stiffnesses to ""free of membrane tension""? How are these calculated?","The stiffness type ""free of membrane tension"" describes the plate and disk stiffness of surfaces. Here, the plate stiffness including the shear stiffness perpendicular to the surface plane is linearly elastic and the disk stiffness in the surface plane is nonlinearly elastic with the material model according to ""Drucker-Prager"" depending on the defined thickness and the assigned material. So that the surface behaves ""free of tension"" in the pane direction, the non-linear reacts Material model for elements under tension with a yield stress fy,t approaching zero in connection with a relatively small hardening modulus Ep. For compressive forces, on the other hand, due to a relatively high compressive yield stress fy,c, the elements remain linearly elastic and react with an unhindered transmission of compressive force. Since the stiffness type ""free of membrane tension"" basically modifies the degrees of freedom of surfaces, this type is only used for surfaces in the relevant model types 3D, 2D - XZ (uX/uZ /φY) and 2D - XY (uX/uY/φZ). For a better description of the partial nonlinearity of this surface stiffness type, the version RFEM 5.06.1103 on 4.02.2016 the type was renamed from ""Zugfrei"" to ""Membrazugfrei"". "
"would like to save foundations with specific dimensions as a template in the library. Is the? For me, the button for this is deactivated in the ""1.2 Geometry"" dialog.","If you ""design"" the dimensions of the foundation plate, then the option to save the foundation dimensions is inactive. Even if results from a previous calculation are already saved and available. After the first calculation in ""Design"" mode, you can select the designed dimensions of the foundation plate using the ""Dimensions of foundation plate from the Apply calculation"" as ""Start values"" for a new calculation. This deletes the results from the first calculation and runs the program in ""Define dimensions"" mode. In this mode, the option to save the foundation dimensions in the foundation library is now also available."
"When calculating the deformation of my surface model in RF-CONCRETE NL, I get implausibly high values. What can be the reason?","It is quite probable that the high deformations are caused by the consideration of shrinkage and the horizontal support in the model.The shrinkage is considered internally on the load side as a strain, with a failure in this context can be mapped as a result of prevented shrinkage. If the shrinkage strain is prevented by an immovable horizontal bearing, forces are generated that can lead to the failure of the concrete and thus to a significant increase in deformation or even to the instability of the model.In this context, it is important that when using the non-linear deformation calculation, the boundary conditions of the model are mapped as realistically as possible."
Is it possible to include several profiles with different materials in the flexural buckling analysis or how can I combine several profiles?,"It is possible to model any cross-sections with SHAPE-THIN and to carry out a stress analysis within SHAPE-THIN or e.g. B. in RSTAB with STEEL. The FE-LTB module can be used for the stability analysis of general cross-sections. Modules such as STAHL EC3 are dependent on the respective standard, so problems can arise with user-defined cross-sections. Here it is usually the case that these are not covered by the standard and the proof of stability is only valid for certain cross-sections. For cross-sections made of several materials (hybrid cross-sections) you can also work with FE-LTB. The stiffness of such a cross-section created in SHAPE-THIN can be mapped in RFEM, but there are no options for the stress analysis. The approach would therefore be the following: 1. Create cross-section in SHAPE-THIN 2. Import cross-section into RFEM and set reference material correctly 3. Calculate internal forces with FE-LTB 4. Conduct stress analysis in SHAPE-THIN"
The printout report reacts very sluggishly. How can I increase performance?,"The speed of the printout report primarily depends on the amount of data to be printed. If a lot of pages are printed, a delay is to be expected. The number of graphics to be printed and in particular the graphic resolution also play a decisive role. When printing on a DIN A4 format, it doesn't matter much It makes sense to print the graphics with the maximum resolution (5000 x 5000 pixels), especially since this requires a file size that is 25 times higher than the standard resolution (1000 x 1000 pixels).When working in the printout report, the printer driver is mainly accessed, which is set as the standard in the operating system's control panel. If these are outdated or incorrect, this can also lead to delays. In this case, it makes sense to choose a printer other than the default. In particular, virtual printers such as PDF24 usually lead to a significant increase in performance. "
In FUND Pro I get extremely large foundations for my structure or I have to enter a very high superimposed load so that the verification of the foundation torsion is complied with. What can be the reason?,"Please check the load input in the ""1.4 Loads"" input dialog in the ""Characteristic values"" tab. A possible source of error is that you used the individual load cases (e.g. e.g. own weight, wind, etc.). Possibly these load cases are then also set as ""permanent"". The program will now apply both load cases for the verification of the 1st core width.This is not correct . For the verification of the 1st core width, only the load from a permanent action is to be applied. For the verification of the 2nd core width, the load from a ""permanent and variable combination"". However, this means that you need either a load combination (LC) or a result combination (EC) for this. The input of a load case (here only wind) is also incorrect, since the vertical component from the superimposed load, which has a favorable effect, is missing. Therefore you get foundations that are too large or you have to enter a high load as ""permanent load"" so that the verification is adhered to. So you should choose this one Create an LK situation in which the ""permanent and variable actions"" are summarized and use them for the design in FUND Pro. Pay attention to the assignment of this SC to a ""permanent + variable action""."
Can you use the program to generate wind loads on the model according to DIN EN 13782?,"No, the program currently does not offer wind load generation according to DIN EN 13782. In the ""Extras"" menu, however, a large number of load generators are available, depending on and independent of various standards. You can find an overview of all load generators under the following link. https://www.dlubal.com/de/produkte/fem-statik-software-rfem/lastgeneration Because the wind load generation can be set to any model geometries is a very complex topic and the standards only output suitable cp values for certain body shapes, our product portfolio also includes the RWIND Simulation program as an alternative. This program simulates the wind flows around any building in a numerical wind tunnel and generates the resulting wind loads for further structural calculations. You can find more information under the following link. https://www.dlubal.com/en/products/independent-static-software/rwind-simulation"
"In the masonry material library there is a ""g/t"" ratio. What does this mean exactly? ",The ratio g/t is the ratio between the total width of the mortar strip and the thickness of the masonry wall. The ratio of the butt joint mortar should not be less than 0.4 according to the standard specification.
How to hide the label of cuts?,"The labels of all sections can be hidden in the Project Navigator - Show by checking the Sections -> designations is deactivated.If only the designations of individual sections are to be hidden, these must first be selected. Then select the command ""Visibility by hiding selected objects"". "
"I downloaded the installation packages from the Dlubal website. When I try to install them, my security software warns me that the installation packages contain malware. Is that really the case?","This is a false alarm. However, our installation files are definitely free of viruses and other malware. This is carefully checked before each release of a new customer version. The files are transferred via a secure https connection, so that manipulations during the transfer are also excluded. "
I want to graphically display bearing loads on screen. Unfortunately for some reason it doesn't work anymore. ,"Check whether the results of the selected load case are calculated and the support reactions are activated. If point 1 didn't work, probably the settings in the Show navigator are the cause of the problem. In this case, it is a good idea to reset the settings in the Show navigator to the default settings. To do this, open the Show navigator. Then right-click on an entry in the navigator to open the context menu shown in the graphic below. You can select the ""Dlubal Standard"" entry in the context menu. This will reset the settings to default and the bearing forces display should work again."
What is the sign definition for the non-linearity of a line release?,"The direction definition is basically determined by the line release axis system and the position of the released object. The display of the line release axis system can be done in the Project Navigator - Show under Model -> Line releases are activated.To determine the direction for the non-linearity definition, it is important how the released object moves relative to the line release axis system of the original element. The loading shown under 1 and 2 would move the released area 2 against the z-axis of the line release axis system. The line release would therefore not be effective with these loads, i.e. the areas 1 and 2 would be firmly connected."
Why is the fiber cutting angle not taken into account when dimensioning a haunched beam?,"You have probably performed a design according to DIN1052:2008 in RF-/TIMBER Pro and are using a cutting angle of less than 3°. According to Section 10.4.1 (1) of DIN 1052, such a cutting angle does not need to be taken into account. If you change the design to the current DIN EN 1995, the verification is also performed for angles smaller than 3°.In addition, it is also possible in the module to calculate transverse tensile stresses in the ridge etc. according to Section 6.4.3 ff. of the Eurocode to be examined. This procedure is explained in detail in a webinar."
According to which coordinate system are line hinges aligned and evaluated?,"Axial/transverse joint or spring The degrees of freedom are based on the following axis definition: The x-axis points in the direction of the line; the y-axis represents the tangent to the surface plane, the z-axis the normal to the surface. These input fields or columns control the degrees of freedom for normal and shear forces. If a control field is ticked, this means that displacement in this direction is possible and the force is therefore not transferred. The constant of a displacement spring can also be entered. Moment hinge or spring The degrees of freedom of the moments are related to the local hinge coordinate system (axis x in the direction of the line, Axis y as tangent and axis z as normal to the surface plane). A tick means the twist is free and the internal size is not propagated. The constant of a torsion spring can also be entered. Evaluation of the release resultsRefer to the results of the line hinges also refers to the internal line joint coordinate system (x axis in the direction of the line, y axis as a tangent and z axis as a normal to the surface plane). DOFDescription nShear flow along the Line vzShear force parallel to the surface axis z vyShear force tangential to the surface plane."
"Why is the ""Wind flow on side"" field grayed out in the wind load generator after selecting the nodes for the basic and roof geometry?","When selecting the nodes for the basic geometry and the roof geometry, it must always be ensured that the nodes have the same arrangement as in the graphic, i.e.:nodes A via node INode B via node JNode C via node K Node D via Node L "
How is the effective static height calculated in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces?,"Depending on the reference setting in Window 1.4 - Reinforcement Arrangement, the effective static height is calculated using the edge or the axis dimension of the reinforcement. In addition, only the minimum height of the top or bottom is used for one direction. For example, for an area with a thickness of 180 mm, a concrete cover of 30 mm and a rod diameter of 10 mm (basic reinforcement), the useful static height is either 150 mm (reference to edge) or 145 mm (reference to axis dimension)."
"When attempting to calculate a truss structure, the error message 1677 ""Member no. 75: Invalid buckling length coefficients."" ","In RSTAB 8 and RFEM 5, the effective length coefficients can be specified during input, which are then transferred to the add-on modules.If the message described appears, the entry of the coefficients in an old version was set to 0 set. Because of this incomplete member definition, a calculation in the main program is not possible. To fix this, a value > 0 can be entered.If the buckling length factors are not yet relevant for the design, you can select the entire model and then open the ""Edit member"" dialog by double-clicking a member. Then set the coefficients back to the standard value 1.0 in the ""Effective Lengths"" tab."
"Why aren't all stresses displayed in the results navigator? Even with the internal forces, not all options are shown.","This depends on the choice of model type. In this case, a planar system was chosen. The relevant results are only displayed for this level, as these are reduced due to the restricted coordinates and degrees of freedom. If, on the other hand, a 3D system is selected as the model type, all stresses and internal forces are displayed."
"Why isn't the ""without narrow side gluing"" ticked by default in RF-LAMINATE?","The hook for narrow side bonding generally relates to the dimensioning of cross laminated timber surfaces. However, the RF-LAMINATE module is also suitable for other materials such as carbon fibers, plastics or laminated glass. Therefore, this setting cannot be set by default. However, it is possible to set this as the default."
"In RF-PUNCH Pro I use the sector model to determine the load increase factor ß. Because of singularities in the surface internal forces, the ß-values are sometimes set too high. How can I deal with it?","It is correct that singularities in the FE calculation also affect the results of the determination of the load increase factor ß using the sector model. Smoothing areas inserted in the RFEM model have an impact on the ß- Determination in RF-PUNCH Pro has no influence. If the results in the critical perimeter are influenced by the singularities, you have the option of specifying the load increase factor ß yourself . To do this, you can display the ""Shear force in sectors"" in the results navigator of RF-PUNCH Pro. The maximum value of all sectors is used to determine the ß-coefficient. In our Knowledge Base you will also find a Technical article for determining the load increase factor ß. You can now estimate by engineering whether this value should be used for determining the load increase factor or not. If not, you as the user can evaluate the course of the shear force in the sectors and determine the load increase factor ß yourself (average value of the sector under consideration/average value over the entire perimeter). In RF-PUNCH Pro you have the option of specifying the load increase factor ß directly in the ""1.5 Punching node"" input dialog. You can thus avoid values that result from a singularity by individually specifying the load increase factor ß. It is important:The The program cannot provide an automatic function for this. These points must always be checked and evaluated individually by the planner."
How can I output the stiffness matrix of the surfaces from the RF-LAMINATE module in the printout report?,"It is currently not possible to output the stiffness matrix of the surfaces from the LAMINATE module in the report. However, it is quite easy to insert them into the log via the clipboard. The process is explained in the attached video."
"We have modeled and calculated a steel hall in RSTAB. At the same time, we want to calculate the corresponding floor slab in RFEM. Can we transfer the ""foundation loads"" (bearing loads of the hall columns) to this RFEM model and combine them again for the floor slab?","If you do not open the hall in RSTAB but in RFEM (create a copy of the model and change the file extension from *.rs8 to *.rf5), support forces can be adopted after the calculation and saving. To do this, open the ""Extras"" in the model of the floor slab and select ""Apply support reactions as loads"". Then the support reaction can or must be applied individually for each load case. The load combinations are then compiled in RFEM as usual."
Is it possible to open an RFEM 5 or RSTAB 8 file in an older program version? ,"It is possible. For example, if you select ""All files"" for the file type under ""Open"" in RSTAB 7, RSTAB 8 files are also visible. These can be opened. A warning message then appears, since of course features that are not included in the older version cannot be taken into account.Another possibility is to copy the file from *.rs8 to *.rs7, it can also be opened directly. The warning also appears then.This procedure works analogously for RFEM."
I need to prove a complex solid. Why is the memory volume of the result file so large? Can this be reduced?,"Mostly it is due to the accuracy of the results. Due to the complex networking, volume elements in particular require a lot of computing power and, of course, hard disk space. Depending on how fine or coarse the size of the FE mesh was selected, the smaller or larger the required hard disk space is."
How do I find out how the self-weight of the foundation slab or any superimposed load on the foundation slab is taken into account in the design?,"For all designs that are performed in RF-/FUND Pro, the design details with all intermediate values are available for viewing and checking. To view the intermediate results, you can go to the results mask "" 2.2 Relevant proofs"". There you select a design from the upper table, e.g. B. ""Bearing (EC 7, 6.5.2)"". The detail table in the lower part of the dialog then changes and shows all intermediate values for this verification. For example, how the self-weight of the foundation plate is determined and for the respective evidence is applied. Or how the overburden is taken into account in the verification. The partial safety verifications change depending on the verification. This can also be seen in the intermediate values. "
Can I define the soil layers for the soil profile with soil parameters myself?,"Yes. You can create the soil profile yourself according to your requirements. By default, a soil layer with a thickness of 10 m and a ""gravel-sand-fine-grain mixture"" is initially used for the soil profile. In the dialog for creating the soil profile, you can define an individual soil profile for your construction project and also define new additional soil layers here. Various materials are available in the material library. You can specify the thickness of the individual layers individually. The interactive graphic on the right-hand side of the dialog is used to check the input. The soil parameters can be adjusted individually for the respective layer and deviate from the values from the library. As soon as you adjust a soil parameter, the name of the soil layer is marked with an *."
noticed that the comments e.g. B. for cross-sections in the add-on modules do not match those in RSTAB / RFEM. ,"Comments that are subsequently changed in the main program are not automatically updated in the add-on module if a different comment was previously entered in the add-on module. This gives the user the option of using different comments in the add-on module than in the main program. If the comments in the add-on module are to be synchronized with those in the main program, all comments in the add-on module must be deleted, the input field changed and then the module closed with ""OK"". When the module is opened again, the comments are read in again."
How can I connect a surface to members in a pinned manner?,"There are many ways to connect a surface to members in an articulated manner. On the one hand, the surface of a frame system or something similar could be defined with an eccentricity and a coupling. This rigid rod is then connected in an articulated manner. This will also be the case in this technical article explained in more detail. As a practicable approximation, it may also be sufficient to connect the connecting members all articulated.There are further possibilities, for example with the option of node release. This possibility is explained in more detail in this article explained."
"In the proof of fitness for use, e.g. E.g. for a steel girder, the superelevation is not taken into account. Is it a program error or is my input faulty?","The deduction of superelevation in the serviceability limit state design is actually not regulated in steel construction. At the request of many customers, however, we have adopted this in accordance with the wood or concrete add-on modules. According to the specification of the standard, however, this value should only be taken into account in the quasi-permanent design combination.This does not apply to the characteristic and frequent design situation. As soon as you adjust the design situation in the add-on module accordingly, the applied superelevation is also subtracted from the resulting deformation."
I need to install several Dlubal program packages on my computer. Is it possible to install all program packages with one click?,"You cannot install the Dlubal products with one click. However, there are tools to make the installation much more efficient.Download the batch installer.https://www.dlubal.com/download/installer.exePut this program in any folder and save the Dlubal installation packages in the same folder or in subfolders.Start the installer.exe with a double click. You will then be asked which products you want to install and you can install them one after the other without further mouse clicks being necessary."
How do I enable the overflow (permanent)? The input field for this is deactivated.,"As soon as the bearing capacity according to EN 1997-1 Appendix D is determined in RF-FOUNDATION Pro and/or the proof of sliding safety is performed, a soil profile must be entered. See also FAQ002748 In this case, entering the soil profile also controls the position of the cover. The The specific weight to be applied for the covering can also be defined in the dialog for the soil profile. If you specify the permissible soil pressure manually and deactivate the proof of sliding safety, the soil profile cannot be entered necessary. In this case you can specify the cover directly in dialog 1.4. "
How can I only display the free loads in a certain area?,"In contrast to structural elements, loads cannot generally be marked and hidden by selection. In the Show navigator, only all loads of the same type (e.g. nodal loads, member loads, free polygon loads,...) can be activated or deactivated for display.Loads are always object-related. So if a part of the structure is hidden, the associated loads are also hidden. The free loads are a special feature. If these are not explicitly assigned to specific surfaces, they are always displayed - even if the loaded surfaces are hidden. It is therefore advisable to only assign the free loads to the corresponding surfaces.This can be done most quickly using Tables 3.6 - 3.11. Note: With the 2D model types, the free loads cannot be assigned to specific surfaces and are therefore always displayed for the entire structure."
Where can I download a valid version if I don't have a service contract?,"Without a service contract, you will not be able to download the latest (current) program version. However, you can find the version that applies to you on the following page: https://www. dlubal.com/en/support-and-training/service/older-program-versions With a Service contract always keep the Dlubal programs up to date. You will receive regular updates from us as well as Perks on future upgrades."
"I don't get any results after calculating my model. However, the results are shown in the additional modules.","The panel that appears after the calculation has been completed has a filter for displaying certain elements. From time to time it can happen that elements are deliberately or unconsciously removed from the results display. It is therefore recommended, if elements are unexpectedly missing from the results display, to first check the panel filter."
Is it possible to have the adaptive FE mesh generation only affect one surface?,"Adaptive mesh generation can only be applied to the entire model, not to individual faces."
I use the add-on module FE Buckling and need more detailed information on how the critical buckling stress is calculated for behavior similar to a buckling beam. The dent stiffeners end in front of the edges. Is the eigenvalue of the buckling stiffener calculated as a member with a contributing plate width? ,"If your buckling stiffeners are not defined over the entire buckling panel length, the FE-BUCKLING program automatically generates this stiffener as a substitute member including the effective width and uses the additional module KNICK to carry out an eigenvalue calculation. This then results in the critical buckling stress of the bar and thus of the stiffener. The length of the replacement bar is the stiffener length. A detailed output of the internal results is not yet possible."
I get a hint that the area is not measured because it is divided into several components. Why is that?,"Since the surface was broken down into components when creating an intersection, the components are now dimensioned. The original surface is not taken into account in the design."
"Do you have a program for the design of columns fixed in concrete? It's not about the dimensioning of the bucket, but about the required embedment depth, existing concrete stress, verification of the shear stress in the support, etc.",The add-on module RF-/JOINTS Steel - Column base offers this type for selection and design. You can find more information on the corresponding Product page of our website.
Can I design ultra high performance concrete (UHFB) in RF-/CONCRETE?,This is currently not possible in the dimensioning modules. Strength classes greater than C 100/115 are not regulated in the standards and require approval in individual cases. These ultra high performance concretes usually behave differently and therefore cannot be designed according to the current methods of the standard.
An error message appears when generating the FE mesh. This states that the tolerance for integrating the nodes into the lines is too large. What should I do?,"Please decrease the maximum distance between the node and the line in the FE mesh settings. Even with a setting of 0.001 m according to the picture, a smaller value can be entered. If the decimal places are adjusted via the corresponding settings, the value is also displayed in full."
An update of my programs is available. How can I make sure my data is not lost?,"The project file usually remains unaffected during an update. In addition, no models are deleted when the program is uninstalled. Only the links in the project manager are lost during deinstallation. However, these are retained during an update.User-defined toolbars, settings for the display properties, etc. can be saved in the configuration manager. This backup file can then be restored if the settings are lost."
Is there a way to measure a custom material in each module?,"If you want to use a user-defined material in the design modules, you must ensure that it has the same properties as a code-specific material. Example: You want a user-defined material in RF -/Concrete dimensioned according to EN 1992-1-1 standard. Proceed as follows to create the material: Select a material from the EN 1992-1-1 series of standards in the material library and select ""Create new material..."". Here you can change all default values. All these values are required for a dimensioning in the add-on."
In RFEM/RSTAB I use cross-sections whose values I specify via direct input. How do I get the RF-/STEEL module to take my cross-sections into account?,"Create a custom cross section. For this cross-section, the stress points with all the necessary values must also be specified. Afterwards, stresses can be calculated at these points of the cross-section in the RF-STEEL Members and STEEL add-on modules."
Why does the load generation using levels or cells sometimes give me negative values in the corner points?,"Even if the implemented load generation tool appears simple at first glance, the procedure used in the background is quite complex.So that linearly variable surface loads can also be converted into linearly variable member loads, there is an option for correcting the generated ones in the detail settings Loads ""According to moments Equilibrium of the total load and generated member loads"" preset. If, for example, there is a rectangular cell with only 3 edge bars, the The load can be distributed in such a way that the resulting moment from the member loads with the respective lever arms to the center of gravity of the cell is equal to zero. This means that negative values are determined in the corner points in the event of a positive load If this effect is not desired, the correction of the generated load can be deactivated or set to ""None"". See also manual section 11.8"
"Why do I get double values in the load generation ""Conversion of area loads to member loads""? ","This is due to the fact that the respective corner nodes for delimiting the surface load level appear twice in the selection window. If one of them is deleted, you get the correct values in the info window after you have pressed OK."
"My model was supposed to be symmetrical, but the bearing reactions reflect an unsymmetrical loading/modeling. What can I do?","Please check the orientations of all supports, members and surfaces and the associated orientations of the loads. It is helpful to display the respective coordinate systems via the display navigator.If this does not solve the problem, first use a load case that is as simple as possible, in which the deformation can be easily understood. Consult the course of internal forces and deformations to identify possible torsion or missing connections. In order to be able to detect twisted loads on surfaces, you can also use the ""Load distribution"" option in the results. It is not uncommon for a supposed connection between a surface and a member not to exist . The FE mesh can also show here whether the connection exists. If the asymmetry remains afterwards, use a copy of the model and successively delete elements there in order to trace the cause of the missing symmetry .If all of this is unsuccessful, please send the model to our hotline with a note of which tests you have already carried out."
Can I also use the wind load generator for open buildings?,"With the load generator it is not yet possible to generate the loads for open buildings. You could generate the loads for a closed hall and then add the missing loads manually. For free-standing roofs, there are other assumptions according to the standard, but which ones are not previously covered in the load generator. There is already an interesting about the wind load on a free-standing roof Technical article on our website. However, the wind load can also be used for generate any building geometries with the new independent program RWIND Simulation. This offers you the options for wind simulation and for generating wind loads. In connection with the FEM structural analysis software RFEM or the framework program RSTAB, the possibilities can be optimally used. InputThe direct transfer From models from RFEM or RSTAB, it is possible to define relevant parameters of the wind directions to be analyzed with height-dependent wind profiles based on a wind standard. This results in the corresponding load cases with additional globally stored parameters. Without RFEM or RSTAB, RWIND Simulation can be operated manually. For this purpose, the data can be imported from STL vector graphics. It is also possible to transfer terrain and buildings in the area to the simulation from STL files. Through the exchange between RFEM or RSTAB and RWIND Simulation, you can easily use the results of the wind analysis as load cases in your usual working environment of RFEM or RSTAB.

Why does the sum of the loads differ from the sum of the support forces? What causes could it be?,"In most cases, these differences are due to lack of convergence. Increasing the iterations and increments in the calculation parameters and FE mesh settings should help.High jumps in stiffness result in numerical problems, which lead to errors in the result evaluation . In RSTAB this is not a major problem with a complete and analytical approach function. In RFEM, on the other hand, approximations are used, so large jumps in stiffness should be avoided. An example of this are rigid rods (very high rigidity) which are connected to softer surfaces or rods. In this case, the rigid member can be replaced by a beam member with a stiff cross-section or by means of stiffening members with high stiffness.In the case of bedding members, deviations can also occur can. If the rods are not divided or only roughly divided, convergence problems arise. A practical solution here is to select a ""finer"" member division in the FE mesh settings.In nonlinear systems, changing the calculation type can also help (see Picture 3)."
How can I use RFEM to check whether my model e.g. B. under the influence of groundwater?,"For this, the water pressure on the underside of the foundation body must be determined and used as a load, e.g. B. surface load. Then you can adjust the properties of the nodal support, line support or surface support so that it fails when the model is pulled or lifted."
What are the differences between a line joint and a line release?,"Line hingeLine hinges control the connections between surfaces. This means that complete decoupling of surfaces or flexible couplings via linear springs can also be taken into account. Internally, line joints are also line releases, except for integrated lines. Such a line hinge works in such a way that the stiffness in the adjacent first row of elements of the assigned surface is reduced according to the selected degrees of freedom. In concrete construction, a line joint can be used, e.g. B. an assembly joint can be defined. In timber construction, modeling using line hinges is necessary, particularly because of the very limited rotational transmission of forces.Line releaseLine releases can be used to decouple elements (members, surfaces and volumes) connected to a line . A new line is generated at the same location, transferring only the locked degrees of freedom. In contrast to the line joint, non-linear effects can also be taken into account. First the line release type must be created. This defines the open degrees of freedom or spring constants and any non-linearities. Then the lines can be released for members, surfaces and volumes on individual lines. The axis system of the release can also be manipulated in the same dialog window.If line hinges have already been used in the model, they can be quickly converted to a line release. This makes it very easy to take into account non-linear effects in the system. "
"I have received a new V2C file for the network license. When trying to import this into the license server, I get the message Error Code 55: HASP_UPDATE_TOO_NEW or Error Code 54: HASP_UPDATE_TOO_OLD What can be the reason?","The updates of the network licenses are tied to an internal consecutive numbering.If the order is not applied exactly, one of these messages appears. An older update file was probably forgotten to be installed with error code 55.If the older update is carried out first, the new file should then also be accepted. In the case of error code 54, an outdated C2V file was probably used instead of the current one. The message also appears if an attempt is made to apply the latest update a second time.

Why don't I get any stresses as a result for an orthotropic surface?,"Stresses cannot be calculated for every orthotropic thickness type. For the following orthotropic stiffnesses, stresses are also calculated: Stiffness type orthotropic with a constant thickness.Material model orthotropic 2D with a constant thickness.For all stresses are not calculated for other orthotropic surface types. For an orthotropy model with different thicknesses in the x and y direction, the representation of the stresses for the x and y direction would be relatively complex and also not comprehensible. The three basic stiffnesses are defined in the attached file. "
Is it possible to quickly generate a truss with RSTAB and RFEM?,"Trusses can be modeled, calculated and designed according to various standards quickly and effectively with RSTAB and RFEM. For such models, it is particularly recommended to use the model generator for 2d trusses. After entering the cross-section parameters and geometry details, the model is automatically created by the model generator. "
"When I try to calculate a material from the ""Aluminium"" category in the RF-/EL-PL module, I get an error message. What is the reason for this?","The add-on module RF-/EL-PL is only designed for the design concept elastic-plastic of steel cross-sections. As a result, only materials from the ""Steel"" category can be calculated in the module. "
Why am I seeing an incorrect generated load? It is also displayed in red in the project navigator.,"When a load is generated, e.g. For example, corner nodes for the surface load level are incorrectly copied (see video), it can happen that the generated load is damaged. The generated load is then not deleted but displayed in red. In addition, when attempting to calculate the model, the error message ""No member was found in the selected area."" is displayed. The generated load must therefore either be deleted or the missing delimitation of the surface load plane must be redefined."
How can an offset of members in a certain connection point be taken into account?,"There are basically two options here:The use of member eccentricities, see technical article Consideration of member and surface eccentricitiesFor example, in the case of differently defined member end hinges in combination with different ones The use of couplings or rigid rods can help to measure offsets"
Why can't I create dimensions? I can't select nodes or bars. Points and nodes are not snapped.,"The status bar is located in the bottom area of the work window of RSTAB and RFEM. The middle area can be used to influence the display in the working window. If the options SNAP and OSNAP are activated, grid points, nodes and objects can be snapped. After that, the system can be dimensioned."
"Is it possible to group individual objects (surfaces, members,...) in RFEM and RSTAB?","A visibility can be used to show a section of a model or a group of objects (e.g. faces of a level, columns of a floor). In the project Navigator - Views there is the possibility to manage ""User-defined visibilities"", which can be individually defined. Furthermore, ""Generated visibilities"" are created automatically by the program. "
In RF-/DYNAM Pro I have the possibility to select a transformation type for the mass. What do the different options mean and what are the differences?,"This setting defines how the defined loads in RFEM/RSTAB are treated in the dynamics module, since they must first be transformed into masses. Z-Load Shares: If this option is selected , only those masses that act in the Z-direction are taken into account. This includes the positive as well as the negative direction. This option is preset because it is desired in most applications. Loads, such as earth pressure, which are defined in a horizontal direction, are not taken into account. Z-load components (in the direction of gravity): Here the loads are only taken into account in positive Z-axis. If you want to use this option, you should check in which direction the Z-axis was defined. With this option, it does not matter in which direction you have applied the self-weight in a load case. Full load as mass: With this option, all loads converted into masses, both horizontal and vertical. The direction is no longer taken into account in the mass case. For this reason, RF-/DYNAM Pro first forms the load resultant when loads with different directions act on a node."
Which interfaces are available for export?,"Interface between RFEM / RSTAB and Autodesk Revit RFEM and RSTAB communicate via a direct interface to Revit Structure and enable data exchange. Structures modeled with RFEM and RSTAB can be easily transferred to Revit Structure at the push of a button. RFEM/RSTAB are based on an object-oriented building model, Revit on parametric modeling. This means that the intelligence of the objects is not lost during data exchange. This means that for a column or beam you get an equivalent object in Revit or RFEM/RSTAB and not just a collection of lines.Direct RSTAB / RFEM interface to Autodesk AutoCAD The members are exported from RFEM/RSTAB as lines. The layers of these lines contain information about the cross-sections and materials used. When exporting a DXF file from RFEM, in addition to the entire model - including the FE mesh - the numbering can be exported, which is controlled via Navigator. Another possibility of exporting from RFEM/RSTAB is to export results in to transfer the form of isolines to a DXF file. Various elements such as isolines, FE mesh, values, etc. can be specifically selected. Direct RSTAB / RFEM interface to Tekla Structures With the direct integrated interface, the analytical model of detailed systems from Tekla Structures can be easily transferred to RFEM / RSTAB. In the event of changes in the structural design, the direct interface can be used to quickly update the Tekla model, by reconciling the changed materials, profiles and coordinates. It is also possible to remove construction elements that no longer exist or to add new ones. Interfaces to Rhino & Grasshopper Rhino interface: Both lines and surfaces including openings can be transferred to RFEM (export) or transferred from RFEM (import). The following line types can be transferred: line, polyline, arc, circle, ellipse, parabola and NURBS. In addition, the exchange of these surface types is possible: plane, surface of revolution and NURBS. Grasshopper interface: The Dlubal tab in Grasshopper is activated with the interface. This includes three components. The ""Surfaces"" component allows adding Dlubal-specific surface properties (material, thickness, surface stiffness type) to 2D geometries. With the ""Bar"" component, bar-specific properties (material, cross-section, bar rotation) can be added to incoming lines or curves. The third component enables direct export to RFEM. Other exchange formats DXF, IFC, STP (e.g. for Intergraph, Advance Steel, SEMA, Cadwork, HSB-Cad etc.), DSTV (e.g. for Bocad and Frilo), FEM (Glaser) and CFE (Strakon), XLS (Microsoft EXCEL), CSV, ISM.DGN, DGN (Bentley ISM), DAT, SMLX (Advance Steel), ASF (Nemetschek Allplan), ESF A detailed overview of the interfaces and BIM-oriented Planning is available on our website Building Information Modeling (BIM). In addition, there are already numerous Webinars on BIM, which can be viewed as a video on our website. "
Why are the results deleted when opening an RSTAB7 / RFEM4 file in RSTAB8 / RFEM5?,"The model information and loads are adopted when opening an old RSTAB7 / RFEM4 file. Due to the constant further development of our software and the implementation of new features, it is not always possible to process results. A corresponding message window then appears when you open it. If you want to analyze the results, we recommend opening the file in the corresponding RSTAB7 / RFEM4 program version."
"How to permanently save the parameters in the ""Units and decimals"" dialog? ","In order for the settings under units and decimal places to be saved permanently, you have to save the profile. All profiles can then be read out with the ""Read in profile"" button. In this way you can, among other things, switch very quickly between the metric and imperial systems. "
 Can I combine the non-linear calculation in RF-CONCRETE NL with the determination of subgrade parameters in RF-SOILIN?,"This should be possible if only one combination is used in the nonlinear calculation. The theoretical background is that RF-SOILIN cannot consider several situations with different bedding parameters in parallel. Only one case can be considered at a time. If several load situations are considered in RF-CONCRETE NL, there are theoretically several systems with different stiffness. In connection with RF-SOILIN this leads to a contradictory situation."
"Why does the web service write ""ERROR: Map not found.""?","In this case, the URL module ""map"" does not seem to be correct. The ""map"" module describes the load type and standard of the location-specific load query sought. The 1st part the load type (e.g. snow, wind or earthquake) and the 2nd part the standard (e.g. din-en-1991-1-3). The 1st part must always be written in English, regardless of the ""language"" module. → map=snow-din-en-1991-1-3 "
"Why do I get a bending moment in the surface in the area of the column in my model, although the surface has been provided with a line hinge?","The surface on the right receives a moment in the area of the column because this surface is rigidly connected to the column (the surface itself does not have a line hinge). If you want to exclude this moment, you would have to create an additional line hinge for the right surface or provide the column with a member end hinge."
"In my model with many bent bars, the coordinate systems of the bars are not evenly aligned. What can I do to improve this?","If the coordinate systems of the members are not consistently the same in structures with many arcs (see model on the right in the picture), then the member rotation or line rotation can be carried out very easily with an auxiliary node (result see model on the left in the picture)."
"When trying to start RSTAB/RFEM, only the message appears:Sentinel HASPFailed to create the self-pipe socket with error 10093/WSANOTINITIALISED.Likely Winsock DLL is malfunctional or was unloaded meanwhile HASP API is still in use.This is an unrecoverable error!Aborting...How can I solve this?","The cause of this message is usually a faulty graphics card driver. After updating the driver via the graphics card manufacturer's website, the message mentioned should no longer appear and the programs should start as usual."
Can I check in the program whether the sums of the bearing forces match the sums of the loads?,"The results are summarized in the RSTAB and RFEM results mask 4.0. There, among other things, all the totals of the bearing forces with the totals of the loads are listed for each load case."
"Why can't I select any sets of members for the serviceability limit state analysis in the respective design modules? I cannot specify sets of members under ""Serviceability parameters"".","The sets of members must first be selected in the general data in order to be able to design them for the corresponding limit states. After that, various specifications for the proof of serviceability can be made in the serviceability parameters."
"After the calculation, I only see the maximum result value for the deformations. Can I also display all node prefixes?","In order to output the desired node values, the option ""node shifts"" activated in the Show navigator."
"Is there a way to influence the distribution of the loads? We would like to influence the stiffness of the walls, but we haven't found a way to do this.","The easiest way to manipulate the stiffness is to use a new material in which the E and shear modulus is manually reduced and only assigned to the corresponding walls. Alternatively, you can use line joints with displacement springs at the connection to the ceiling. But you would have to create a new material for this as well. However, it is a little error-prone, since this stiffness reduction has to be assigned to the desired LF's and LK's. It is therefore not automatically applied to all LF's and LK's, but only to those assigned - unless the button ""Settings... apply to all LK's"" is then pressed. "
How can I quickly create an arc (catenary) with RSTAB / RFEM?,"The easiest way to do this is with the ""Generate sheet"" function. The values h1, h2 and h3 result from the graphic on the right in the dialog. Accordingly, h1 and h3 are the distances from the edge nodes to the top of the catenary. The value h2 forms the mean value from this. Furthermore, in this mask you can specify how many divisions and which member type the members should have."
I need the load combinations from 1.00*G + 1.50*Q for a verification. How can I have these generated automatically?,"You will find this option in the settings for the combination rules. There you can check ""Favorable permanent action"".On the one hand, combinations with 1.35*G + 1.50*Q generated. On the other hand, you get the same combinations with 1.00*G + 1.50*Q. These can then be used in the additional modules for further proofs."
"In the graphics print properties, I specified an absolute width for the color scale.But this is not applied. What can be the reason for this?","If the color scale is placed outside the graphic, an additional width specification becomes active for this special case. This takes precedence over the dimensions of the scale size on the right-hand side. "
"When calculating insulating glass made of laminated safety glass, is it possible to carry out the calculation in 2D or are volumes always automatically used for insulating glass?","For insulating glass with consideration of the shear bond, calculations are always made with solid bodies. If you switch off the shear compound, you can then calculate with surface elements."
"How can the fatigue analysis for reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete be carried out in RFEM? I found a result combination of type fatigue, but I can't find the check in the modules.","The verification is not yet implemented in the RF-CONCRETE modules. The input parameters for the design, such as the reinforcing steel stress, can be determined in RF-CONCRETE Members or Surfaces. The verification itself currently has to be carried out outside of the program.

The result combination of the type Fatigue is to be used for this. "
"For a verification with RF glass according to DIN 18008, I have to carry out a calculation with full and one without laminate for insulating glass with laminated safety glass. Is it possible to do this in a single model and just one run?","Unfortunately, it is not possible to carry out the calculation with and without shear bond in one file. A separate file must be created for each status."
"Why do I need to define a soil profile in FUND Pro? I specify the permissible soil pressure myself, don't I?","The soil profile in RF-/FOUNDATION Pro is not only required to determine the permissible soil pressures. Entering the soil profile is required and activated if one of the following verifications is performed. - Bearing failure verification by determining the resistance according to EN 1997-1 Appendix D- Sliding safety verification- Settlement calculation If the bearing failure resistance is specified by the user and the settlement calculation and the proof of sliding safety are deactivated, the program does not need to evaluate the soil profile and the input dialog for the soil profile is blocked."
"I have defined springs on the top flange of my crane runway girder. The permissible deformation is now calculated based on the distance between the springs, how can I change this?","For crane runway girders that are held laterally by a flexible spring (rolling bracing), method 3 is set under Details under ""Permissible deformations"". With this, the length for determining the allowable deformation is related to the inflection points of the deformed member axis. If you want to relate the allowable deformation to the length between the start and end supports, this must be calculated manually."
Can I also carry out a fatigue analysis with the Dlubal programs?,"Yes, there is an additional module for the fatigue analysis of steel frameworks. You can find more information about RF-/STEEL Fatigue Members under the following link:https://www.dlubal.com /en/products/rfem-and-rstab-additional-modules/steel-and-aluminum-construction/rf-steel-fatigue-rods For steel surfaces as well as Unfortunately, there is currently no additional module available for surfaces and members in reinforced concrete construction."
"I have to calculate an open hall with low roof loads and relatively high wind loads in comparison. Theoretically, one would also have to provide evidence of buckling/tilting of the lower chord. Unfortunately, the combination 1.0 *G +1.5 *W. is missing",Additional combinations of favorable permanent actions can be taken into account in RSTAB / RFEM using the Combination Rules mask and in RX-TIMBER using Mask 1.4. 
"When calculating a glass pane with RFEM, no stresses are displayed. Is there an error?","No stress is displayed in RFEM for the surface stiffness type ""Glass"". The reason for this is that this stiffness type is just a placeholder for the add-on module RF-Glass. This means that further inputs such as e.g. B. Layers, nodal supports, edge members and inputs for the load duration are necessary. These entries can be made in the add-on module RF-GLASS. The stresses, loads and deformations per layer can also be evaluated in the additional module. There are already two interesting Webinars for the RF-GLASS add-on module on our homepage."
How can I integrate a WORD file into the printout report?,"Text files from Microsoft Office can be included in the RSTAB / RFEM printout report if they were saved in ""rtf"" format. To do this, select the ""Text file"" function in the printout report using the ""Insert"" button."
Is it possible to reconnect divided lines or members?,"It depends on the starting position. Currently, lines and members can only be reconnected or reunited if no other elements are connected to the dividing nodes. In order to unite the multiply divided member, the intermediate nodes must be selected. The ""Delete nodes -> Merge connected lines/members"" function can then be called up in the context menu. This function is not available for the lower system, as the definition nodes of the connected beam are deleted by merging would. "
How can you find out which lengths of a cross-section are installed?,"parts list of the cross-sections can be generated with the design modules (e.g. RF-/STEEL EC3) and exported to Excel.The table of members can also be exported to Excel. This table can then be evaluated in Excel using a PivotTable, for example.In addition, information such as the length of bars or the material mass can be determined using the ""Center of gravity and information"" function. To do this, first select the members with the relevant cross-section and then select the ""Center of gravity and information"" command from the context menu.Alternatively, a parts list can be output with the RF-/ RS-COM interface can be programmed as described in COM interface in VBA | Creating a Bill of Materials shown."
Can you set a plastic calculation of the internal forces in RSTAB or are the internal forces only calculated elastically?,"In RSTAB, there is also the option of determining plastic internal forces. To do this, a plastic hinge must be selected as non-linearity via the member properties. However, this does not include any interaction of the plastic internal forces. Another possibility is to set joints with non-linear properties directly. However, with this method you have to estimate beforehand where these hinges will form. In RFEM, you have the option of selecting a corresponding material model."
"In RFEM, additional information can be displayed in the display navigator for the results of line supports. How are these values to be interpreted?",Additional information is available for each line support in the work window. These are to be interpreted as follows: 𝛴 : Sum as the resulting force𝛷 : Average valuex : Distance of the line center from the beginning of the linee : Eccentricity of the resultant related to the line centerM : Moment of eccentricity of the resultant
Why does the module start in the demo version even though I have read in a current and valid authorization for it?,"If the import of the current authorization file was successful and the program is otherwise running correctly, the problem cannot be localized so easily. Therefore, please send us the diagnosis file ""authorization.txt"". You can create this via the menu ""Help → Authorization → Diagnosis""."
"After entering the support widths in the RF-CONCRETE Members module and starting the calculation, the error message ""Support width too large!"" appears. What should I do?",One of the members adjacent to a support is shorter than or equal to the entered support width. Please change the boundary conditions so that the member is longer than the bearing width.
How can I hide the scale in a graphic in the printout report?,"If you print a scaled graphic in the printout report, this is also automatically displayed in the printout report graphic. The display of the scale cannot be hidden."
Is direct import and export possible with Autocad?,"RFEM includes an interface to programs from Dlubal. The input data of all RFEM previous versions are imported without any problems. The files of the framework program RSTAB can also be opened directly and supplemented with surface or volume elements. Conversely, files created in RFEM 5 can be opened with RSTAB 8. There is a direct link to the CAD applications of Tekla Structures and AutoCAD (but not for LT versions). With RFEM, the advantages of BIM (Building Information Modeling) can be used to exchange data models for digital planning."
"What is the fastest way to export a model, including all loads, to an EXCEL file and import it again later?","The export of the model is possible without any problems. Various interfaces are available via the export function of the program. The desired tables including formulas can be quickly transferred to EXCEL via the EXCEL interface. Conversely, the tables can of course also be read back into RSTAB / RFEM using the import function."
"In the graphical representation, my bars overlap, although the cross-sectional dimensions and spacing should not. How can I fix this?","A magnification factor was set in the display properties for the display of the members. If this is set to 1.0, the cross sections are displayed with their original dimensions again."
How can I upload an update for the network dongle on the server?,"Please open the Admin Control Center on the server via http://localhost:1947 Then switch to the Update/Attach category and use ""Select file"" to select the V2C file(s) provided by us( en) off. After that, press ""Add File"". If the update is successful, you will receive a corresponding message."
I want to apply a rectangular load to only part of the area. How do I do that?,"A free rectangular load can be applied to a freely definable area of a surface. A free rectangular load can be inserted via the menu Insert -> load -> Free rectangular loads, can be inserted via the corresponding button in the toolbar or via the table. "
Is it possible to look at the intermediate results of e.g. B. Steel EC3 also displayed in the printout report?,"Yes, that is possible. In the selection of the printout report, intermediate results of the add-on module can be displayed with the corresponding button in the ""Results"" tab."
The pages of my printout report appear in landscape format. Can this be changed? ,Whether the pages of the log should be displayed in portrait or landscape format is set in the printer settings. 
"I don't understand the error message ""Line is loaded, but doesn't belong to the area"" and I can't find any input error either.","This notice appears whenever a line is loaded in an area that is not integrated into the area. Usually not only error 10305 but also error 10306 is displayed in the combination. It is then necessary to manually integrate the line into the area. You can do this in the ""Edit surface"" dialog, ""Integrated"" tab.This measure is usually only necessary for ""non-planar"" surfaces, since lines, nodes and openings from flat surfaces are automatically integrated into the respective surfaces."
I use surfaces of revolution in my model. Now opening and editing the file takes a long time. What can I do about it?,"Revolution surfaces are mostly used in RFEM to easily model and calculate geometric conditions. However, if you use a large number of surfaces of rotation in the model, performance can drop. This is due to the definition of the surfaces, because they have to be generated again and again in the background using the boundary conditions if there is a change in the system.It is therefore recommended to replace these surfaces of rotation with surfaces of the ""Quadrangle "" to replace, which significantly reduce the amount of data. In addition, with quadrangle surfaces it is also possible to apply loads to only parts of the surface."
How can I send the current status of a NET-SOFTLOCK to Dlubal Support?,"Please send us the C2V file of the NET-SOFTLOCK. To do this, open the Admin Control Center on the server via http://localhost:1947. Under Sentinel Keys you will find the CLONED NET softlock and at the end of the line a button ""C2V""."
The authorization file does not seem to be accepted. Is this damaged?,"Apparently an error occurred while creating the authorization file. It is best if you download a new authorization file from our homepage, enter your user data and try again."
"I get warning 11006 ""The free load is not used on any surface"" even though the load is exactly on a surface edge. What can I do?","Free line loads have no tolerance to surface boundaries. This means that the coordinates of the line load must match those of the line to the last decimal place. Alternatively, the line load z. B. be shifted inwards by 1mm.In the example shown on the left, the line load runs exactly between two nodes, which, however, do not have absolutely the same coordinates in the x-direction. In this case you can use the [Select] tool in the load dialog to select exactly the nodes."
"Due to a hardware change, we have to switch from Windows 7 to Windows 10. Can the Dlubal programs run under Windows 10?","The current versions of RFEM 5, RSTAB 8, SHAPE-THIN 8 etc. are fully executable under Windows 10. For older Dlubal applications, e.g. B. RSTAB 7 and RFEM 4, we can unfortunately no longer guarantee the compatibility."
How can I read out the load case-related or cross-section-related results of the STAHL EC3 module via RS-COM?,"In the examples from the homepage (""cominterfaces-de.zip"") there is the following EXCEL file for testing:cominterfaces-de\SDK\Examples\Modules\Excel\RS-STEEL_EC3 .xlsHere it is possible to get the following results of an example model in the ""Result Design"" table:Load casewise Cross-sectional "
"I have designed a wall with RF-CONCRETE surfaces. The same amount of reinforcement [cm²/m] is displayed on the outside and inside. Do I now have to insert As,above + As,below? Or just one value (either above or below)?","In RF-CONCRETE surfaces, the ""Top"" or ""Bottom"" position is controlled by the orientation of the local coordinate system of the surface. See also the FAQ000740 The means for a wall that As,bottom or As,top is either the reinforcement on the outside or inside depending on the orientation of the local z-axis can. Both values must be taken into account for the reinforcement planning.So the sum of As,below + As,above."
How do I superimpose generated equivalent loads from earthquake analysis?,"When calculating with the equivalent load method, as the name suggests, an equivalent load is determined from the individual eigenmodes. You can export these equivalent loads to RFEM after successful determination. Load cases are automatically created in RFEM.The exported load cases are now to be superimposed in a result combination. A quadratic superposition must always be used for earthquake replacement loads. Two types of overlay are possible, the commonly used SRSS rule and the CQC rule. In doing so, all load cases from the earthquake are assumed to be constantly acting and superimposed according to the respective regulations. The calculation rules are regulated in the current standards."
"The attempt to design several connection nodes with the same geometry fails. According to the report, the connection geometry is different.","To be able to perform a design for several connection nodes, the following points must match:The different connection nodes must use the same geometry type, e.g. B. Knee joint.Beams and support(s) of the different connection nodes must have the same length.The material of the support cross-sections and the material of the beam cross-sections must match. Beams and support(s) of the different connection nodes must have the same cross-sections.Beams of the different connection nodes must have the same inclination.Deviations in the connection nodes are allowed as be as follows:Different cross-section and material numbers can be used.The number of connected elements, e.g. B. Tension diagonal may deviate.Different joint types can be used."
Saving my structure takes a long time. What can be the reason?,The long storage time can be caused by the virus scanner. Please add exceptions for the real-time scan in the virus scanner. You can find which paths should be added to the exceptions in the following entry: Settings for the Virus scanner 
"I copy a design case and/or select a different or additional node for the design. However, the geometry of the connection defined in the previous design case is not adopted. Why?","As soon as a new node is selected for the design, the geometry is read in again from the main program RFEM or RSTAB and the default values of the connection are preset. Copying the design case is intended for the case that another variant of the previously defined connection is considered. If 2 nodes of the same geometry are to be measured, they should both be selected right at the beginning."
How can I multiply cross-section values by a factor quickly and easily?,"There are several ways to modify cross-section values with a factor: In the ""Edit cross-section"" dialog, there is the option of multiplying moments of inertia or cross-sectional areas by a factor ( ""Modify"" tab). This option should be used if you want to make the modification for each load case, but only for some cross-sections. In the ""Calculation parameters"" of the load cases and load combinations you can also multiply the moments of inertia or cross-sectional areas by a factor. This option changes the values either for all cross-sections at once, or for each cross-section individually. "
Why can't the distance of the nodal forces be set to zero?,Additional [Details] buttons are offered in the display properties for some parameters. You open a new dialog in which e.g. B. the distance or the size of the object can be scaled to the dimensions of the overall model.
"I applied a load ""gradually"". Can the results of the individual stages be saved and also evaluated after the calculation?","Yes, this is possible. In the calculation parameters of the load cases or load combinations, you can set the ""load increases"" or ""load steps"" and select the option to save the results of the load increases should After the calculation, you can control the load levels or increments via the results panel."
Is it possible to display the critical temperature in the fire protection certificate?,"You have the option of entering a final temperature of the steel in the program. This function was implemented, for example, to use results from real fire events or fire test centers and to carry out the verification with a more precise temperature, since the temperature rise in a real fire usually takes place in several phases and is therefore more favorable for the verification. The verification at the temperature level shows that the highest temperature that occurs in the component is lower than the critical steel temperature. The critical steel temperature is the temperature at which the component resistance is just as great as the stress resulting from mechanical loads. This is not proof of ULS, since stability verifications are not usually carried out. This method can therefore be used more for the preliminary design of a component, for example by calculating the critical temperature using the degree of utilization of the moment stress. We do not offer this procedure directly. However, there is the possibility of iteratively determining a critical temperature of the component by specifying the temperature. However, in this case, the stability verifications should also be taken into account. However, the determined critical temperature can be lower than that of the formulas in the Eurocode, since, as already mentioned, no proof of stability is usually taken into account."
Which cross-sections can I design with RF-CONCRETE Columns and RF-CONCRETE Members?,"You can identify the cross-sections suitable for the design by moving the mouse over the individual ""Parametric - Massive"" cross-sections. A window appears with information about the modules in which the respective cross-section can be dimensioned."
Can the modulus of elasticity from state II (calculation with RF-CONCRETE Deflect) be output element by element?,"The Young's modulus in state II is not output directly in the deflect calculation. But you can switch to the ""3.3 Point-by-point serviceability limit state"" dialog box and first create an FE mesh or filter grid point for which you want to see the design details. Then select the result line for the deformation ""uz,local"" in the table. After that, click the [ i ] button to show the design details for that point. In the design details you will then find the intermediate values for the deformation calculation, such as the moment of inertia of the cross-section in state I and state II, the distribution coefficient zeta and the final cross-section values. Since these intermediate values are always determined when the table of design details is opened and are only displayed and temporarily saved for this point, the intermediate values cannot be displayed graphically for the measured area."
"After purchasing a new mouse, I can no longer rotate the model by clicking the wheel + Ctrl. Is there a setting in the program that fixes the problem?","There is no program setting. It is usually sufficient to install the manufacturer's mouse driver. Alternatively, you can rotate the model as follows: 1. You can activate the ""Move view, zoom [Shift], rotate [Ctrl] or [Alt]"" command. If the command has been activated, you can change the view by holding down the left mouse button and [Shift], [Ctrl] or [Alt]. 2. To rotate, you can also rotate the model by holding down the left mouse button and the middle mouse button (mouse wheel) at the same time. Moving the mouse changes the view."
How is the sliding resistance determined in FUND Pro?,"The determination of the sliding resistance in RF-/FOUNDATION Pro depends first of all on whether you use ""drained/consolidated"" or ""undrained/unconsolidated"" subsoil conditions. You can find this setting in the Module in the ""1.1 General information"" input dialog. Depending on the subsoil conditions selected, a different set of formulas is used to determine the sliding resistance. You can find the formulas for this in the RF-/FOUNDATION Pro manual in the theory part.Section 3.1.3 Geotechnical design according to EN 1997-1 from page 40. To open the manual, you can simply press the [F1] key when the module is started or this Use the link to our download area. "
How can you create cross-sections with holes along the x-axis in RSTAB or RFEM?,"With the SHAPE-THIN module you can create any possible cross-section. Otherwise, in RSTAB/RFEM you can only work with parameterizable cross-sections and then apply members parallel. "
Which internal forces does the RF-CONCRETE Surfaces module use for the design? ,"The RF-CONCRETE Surfaces module uses the moments mx and my, the normal forces nx and ny, and the shear forces vx and vy for the design. The transverse forces are then combined to v-max via vectorial addition. "
"The automatic detection of integrated objects in a surface does not work.If I try to integrate them manually into the surface, a message appears that the lines or openings are not in the surface","In particular in the case of imported systems or surfaces lying/standing at an angle in space, it often happens that the nodes are inaccurate. By default, RFEM allows an inaccuracy of 0.5 mm. If this inaccuracy is exceeded, the elements nodes, lines and openings are no longer added automatically. The same inaccuracy is also tolerated with curved surfaces (quadangles).An attempt is now made to add the elements manually into the surface (Edit surface --> ""Integrated"" tab), a corresponding warning message 929 appears regarding elements lying outside the surface.By increasing the tolerance range via ""Extras --> Regenerate model"" can indeed force the recognition of the integrated elements, but then usually leads to a distorted FE mesh and thus also to discontinuities in the FEM calculation.The problem can be solved with flat surfaces using the ""Edit -> Project"" function. To do this, the corresponding elements must first be selected. These are then projected onto the desired level and can then be recognized automatically."
What can I do if network licensing is not working or how can I test whether the required port 1947 is not working?,"You can examine this port using the telnet client. To do this, the Telnet client must first be activated via the Windows internal components. If this is the case, then you can start the following command in the command prompt: telnet xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 1947 (with ""xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"" - IP address of the server) If the input is followed by a blank window, the connection is successful. If the telnet client cannot establish a connection, this will be reported and your IT will establish communication from port 1947."
How can I perform a stability/buckling analysis on a tensile structure? ,"The stability analysis for surface structures can be converted into a pure stress analysis if the calculation is based on the second-order theory and the imperfection required by the standard has been applied to the system. With help imperfection (or a preformed FE mesh) can be created in the RF-STABILITY and RF-IMP modules. The type of imperfection depends heavily on the component and the standard used with it. The values from DIN EN 1993-1-1:2005 5.3 can be used for members that have been modeled as surface structures. For example, the values from DIN EN 1993-1-5:2006 Appendix C can be used for flat surfaces. For shells, the problem is much more complex and there are different approaches. I would advise against generating imperfections here and carry out the buckling safety analysis using the MNA/LBA concept according to DIN EN 1993-1-6, which does not require the use of an imperfection.If, for example, the surface model of a steel girder is to be analyzed you can proceed as follows:1. Select a load with comparatively (compared to other internal forces in the load case) high normal forces. The self-weight load case or a load case combination with the corresponding self-weight is usually suitable here. It may be necessary for each load case combination to be provided with an individual imperfection. 2. Calculate the load combination according to the first-order theory and use it as a basis for RF-STABILITY3. Find the first eigenmode of a global failure with the help of RF-STABILITY4. Using RF-IMP, use the calculated mode shape as the basis for an imperfection. For example, 1/300 of the carrier length can be set as the amplitude.5. Generate a load case combination, which uses the generated imperfection as a basis and is calculated according to the second-order theory.6. Perform a stress analysis based on this load case combination, which is also the stability analysis of the structure. "
Why do the limiting stresses not match the calculated stresses when using a nonlinear material?,"When calculating non-linear material models (especially plastic material models), the calculation is always based on the original constant internal forces. Therefore, the smoothing of the FE elements should be set to ""Constant"".Furthermore, the stresses are related to the principal stresses $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$.Even if these requirements are taken into account, deviations from the defined limit voltage can still occur. They mostly result from the defined hardening modulus. This circumstance is explained in detail in the article that at the links below."
Is it possible to split a line or staff?,"You can split lines and members by right-clicking on the object and then selecting the ""Split line"" or ""Split member"" function in the context menu.The context menu offers three different splitting options ."
I would like to print some images in the printout report for my static model.Do I absolutely have to print the associated tables in the report? I really just want to store images.,"If you want to print graphics in a log, the corresponding sub-item must be active in the selection of the printout log in the ""Global selection"" tab. This means that the tables are also displayed. If only images are to be printed in the report, it is necessary to deactivate the tables in the tabs. Then it is also possible to store sample protocols in order to use them again in other positions. New templates are defined via this printout report menu: Settings → Printout report template → New or New from current report. "
In my model I get different results than with a manual calculation and other software. What could be the reason?,"By default, the shear stiffnesses of the members are activated in the program. The type of calculation and defined stiffness coefficients also have an influence on the calculation. However, the parameters mentioned above are usually neglected in manual calculations, which of course contributes to a difference in the results. If these functions are deactivated, the results usually match the manual calculation. "
How do I get the internal forces and stresses at a surface boundary? ,"If you want to have the results of the edges of an area, you can view the result curves on the line by right-clicking.If there is a bar on the line, you must first hide it. It's probably easiest if you show all the bars in the Navigator > Disable model data."
The printout of the STAHL EC3 results is far too long. How can I reduce the scope to the essentials?,"In the printout report selection you will find filter options, for example to only display the maximum design in the table for members. These filters significantly reduce the scope. The filter options are also available directly in the module."
How to correctly enter the skin friction of bored piles?,"In the example, I made a model with a 0.5m wide bar. Assuming a bedding of 200kN/m³, the displacement spring of 200kN/m³ = 100kN/m² * 1 / 0.5m . If you now want to mount the bar in a spring-loaded manner, you have to multiply the bedding by the bar width (100kN/m³).If you now also want to take skin friction into account, you have to calculate the circumference include in the calculation (see example volume)."
imported an IFC file via the CAD/BIM interface. How does the conversion of the IFC elements into members/surfaces/solids work?,"In principle, the IFC elements can be selected graphically. If you call up the context menu (click with the right mouse button), you can decide for each element whether it should be converted into a member, a surface or a volume.When converting to a member, it now depends on whether the required information is available. Information on the respective IFC objects can be called up in the CAD/BIM Navigator. If suitable cross-section and material designations have been assigned here, the conversion can take place without further adjustments. The tick ""Specify cross-section, material and surface thickness during conversion"" can remain unchecked. If the designations do not match those of the Dlubal libraries, the conversion tables can be used (see: https://www.dlubal.com/de/support-und-schulungen/support/knowledge-base/000794)If no information was stored, Cross-section and material can be defined before conversion. To do this, check the box."
The stability verification in STEEL EC3 has been exceeded. What can I do?,"You can change the profile, generally adapt the model and its loads or activate stabilization measures in STEEL EC3.The settings for rotational restraint and shear panel in the 1.12 Parameters Members or 1.13 Parameters Sets of Members window are particularly suitable for this purpose eigenvalue solver for determining the critical load."
"In an older model in RFEM 4 or RSTAB 7, I designed a SHAPE-THIN cross-section or general cross-section in STEEL EC3. At that time, a cross-section class 1 or 2 was determined. I have now opened the model in RFEM 5 and now the cross-section is only classified as class 3 or 4. Why is that? Was the design more economical back then?","The design of general cross-sections or SHAPE-THIN cross-sections is always elastic in STEEL EC3, ie according to class 3 or 4. Since the interaction conditions are restricted to some cross-sections, no plastic design is possible for any cross-section shape. In RFEM 4 or RSTAB 7, however, a cross-section could still be classified as class 1 or 2, although the subsequent design was elastic.To eliminate this ambiguity and create consistency, the classification was also changed to class 3 and 4 changed."
"I import an IFC file from another CAD program into RSTAB or RFEM using the CAD/BIM option. I get error messages when converting. Likewise, the staffs are not converted correctly. ","CAD programs that are not primarily concerned with static design usually display structural elements as solids. A simple rectangular column would therefore consist of 12 lines and 6 surfaces. The volume can also be defined in different ways. Either via the boundary surfaces (BREP) or as a ""drawn body"" so to speak (Swept Solid). The difficulty now is to generate a 1D element from this 3D element. This is usually only possible if the solids were created as swept solids. The ""Face"" area defines the cross-section. From the direction and length of the extrusion we can read the correct rod placement. In your case it is however, is a BREP. We cannot currently ensure the correct conversion for this type. The warning that should appear during import also refers to this. "
The crash reporter does not open after an unexpected program end. What can I do?,You can try to start the crash reporter manually. The executable file can be found in the directory c:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Dlubal\ImportExport\CrashReporter\So you can at least send us your system information.
"I need results (support reactions) of a design situation for the ""position safety"" for the verification of foundations. How do I get this?","You can have RSTAB or RFEM generate the load combinations required for the design situation of position safety (EQU) according to EN 1990. If you activate the automatic combinatork, there are initially four design situations ( GZT, G Ch, G Hä and G Qs) are available. However, you can create a new additional combination rule and specify a design situation for this (e.g. EQU according to EN 1990). With this specification you receive additional load and result combinations for the design situation ""Reliability"", which you can then use for the design in RF-/FOUNDATION Pro."
How do I set in FUND Pro which load is used for verifying the 1st core size and which load is used for verifying the 2nd core size?,"You will find this setting in the 1.4 Loads module dialog in the ""Characteristic Values"" tab. The permanent action is used to verify the 1st core width. For the verification of the 2nd core diameter, the combination of permanent and variable action is applied. This means that in the list of load cases or combinations for the verification of the foundation torsion (tab - characteristic values), which load should be selected for which action."
Why can't I verify a double bend with the RF-/JOINTS module?,"In the current regulations, fasteners or connections are always verified on one level only. The reason for this is that the proofs for shearing etc. can only be analyzed in the 2D plane. For example, the bearing bearing verification is not possible for a failure from the plane. Since in a three-dimensional calculation there are always internal forces in vy and vz it has proven itself in practice to allow a small proportion of internal forces in the secondary direction and not to fully utilize the connection. However, if the proportion of the lateral force in the secondary direction is too high, a detailed investigation with an FE simulation may be necessary."
How can I rotate the isometric view to my input structure?,"There are several ways to do this. 1. You can activate the ""Move view, zoom [Shift], rotate [Ctrl] or [Alt]"" command.If the command has been activated, you can change the view by holding down the left mouse button and [Shift], [Ctrl] or [Alt]. 2. You can also hold down the [Ctrl] key and the middle mouse button (mouse wheel) to rotate. Moving the mouse changes the view. 3. As an alternative to the [Ctrl] key in 2. you can also hold down the right + middle mouse button and move the mouse."
"If I turn the mouse wheel and thus zoom in or out, the view always jumps in small steps. Can I also zoom continuously or enlarge or reduce the view continuously?","Yes, this is possible. To zoom continuously, you can press and hold the [Shift] or [Shift] key and at the same time click and hold the middle mouse wheel. If you now move the mouse forward (away from you), you reduce the structure. If you drag the mouse towards you, you enlarge the structure or zoom in."
I have already created the lines for an opening. How can I now generate the opening?,"Lines that have already been defined can be selected graphically using the openings list button ""Select boundary lines"" or ""Select boundary lines using window"". The lines must form a closed polyline. "
What does the design note mean: Geometric error on the left side: Front plate of the transom: Lamda2 >1.4 Column flange: Lamda2 >1.4 I can't find an explanation either in the manual or online.,"The auxiliary values λ1 and λ2 are required to determine the effective lengths. With these two values, an α-value is determined from FIgure 6.11 of EN 1993-1-8, which is then used to calculate the effective lengths (at non-circular yield lines) of the T-stub flanges. The maximum value for λ1 is 0.9 and the maximum value for λ2 is 1.4 --> See FIgure 6.11 of EN 1993-1-8 Your geometry results in a λ2 of >1.4 for the end plate, for example. However, α can only be calculated with the maximum value of 1.4 become."
Why does the deflection of the reinforced concrete beam in RSTAB / RFEM in state 1 differ from my manual calculation? ,"It can often be the case that the choice of outdated materials can have an impact on the deformation of the beam. It should be noted that the material characteristics should always be taken from the respective standard. Because the material properties of the same material can differ depending on the standard and its national appendix. In this example, the same concrete was selected, but the concrete has C35/ 45 | DIN 1045-1 compared to concrete C35/45 | DIN EN 1992-1-1 about a lower modulus of elasticity. As a result, there is also greater deflection in the middle of the span of the reinforced concrete beam, which is only loaded by its own weight."
How can I create the line where two surfaces of any shape intersect in space?,"The line can be created with the help of penetration. The line created by the intersection can be converted into a classic line afterwards using the ""Convert to line"" function in the context menu."
Why does the course of the bending moment in the oblique ledger differ from my manual calculation? Normally no bending moments should be calculated there.,"The reason for the creation of a bending moment in the oblique as well as in the straight beam is that the middle column has a certain flexibility due to its finite stiffness. Compression occurs at the middle support, so that the deformation of the middle support also affects the right-hand ledger. Because the right ledger is also held on a movable support, a constraining moment arises at this point. You can see it above all from the respective deformations.The deformation is decisive for the creation of the bending moment in the right part of the system. The calculation using RFEM results in minimal Bending moments, which, however, are not taken into account in the manual calculation."
Is it possible to transfer printout reports from one model to another?,"The direct transfer of a printout report from one model to another is not possible. However, creating a printout report template enables similar reports to be created quickly. In this way, a new printout report template can also be created from an existing printout report. In addition to the content selection and the page settings, additional texts and graphics printed in the report are also included. However, the many dependencies when creating the graphics, such as visibilities and model position, require subsequent editing of the graphics in most cases. For different systems, it is advisable to recreate the graphics using the serial print function. Using the printout report template can save a lot of time with similar models. The sample video briefly shows how to create a printout report from a similar model using the function of the printout report template. The printout report templates are saved in the file RSTABProtocolConfig.cfg or .RFEMProtocolConfig.cfg saved.

You must at least trust dlubal.com to use it. "
"How can I model fillets, bevels, etc.? ","Irregularities in the cross-section geometry can be mapped with point elements. They can be added as fillets, rectangles, circles or triangles or removed from element surfaces. In this way, the area of the point element can also be taken into account or excluded for the cross-section values.Point elements can be inserted via the Insert menu → Cross-section data → 1.5 point elements or via the corresponding button in the toolbar. No stresses are reported on point elements. Point elements are not included in the torsional moment of inertia calculation. This can be compensated for in the Calculation parameters dialog using a correction factor, e.g. B. to detect pronounced fillets. Furthermore, with the function ""Round off or bend corners"" corners and edges of the cross section can be provided with fillet radii and bends. This function is called up via the Edit menu → Round or angle a corner. In the Corner Type section, specify whether the corner area should be rounded or angled. Depending on the specification, the fillet radius r or the shortening by the lengths l1 and l2 must be specified in the Parameters section.The two elements can then be selected in the work window with a mouse click – without closing the dialog. In the section ""Creating between elements no."" the numbers of the elements are displayed.If the ""Detach elements"" check box is active, the overhangs of the original elements in the corner area are deleted after the arc or the new element has been created. The Delete Corner option also removes the node in the corner. In addition, the ""Smooth Corner"" function can be used to model corner areas in great detail without using rectangular point elements. The function is called via the Edit → Smooth corner menu. Then click on one of the two elements in the overlapping area in the working window. The relevant element side is shortened, the adjacent element side lengthened accordingly. A null element creates the connection between the elements."
Which cross-sections and which cross-sections as reinforcement of a crane runway girder are allowed for the design in the add-on module CRANEWAY? ,"For rolled sections, there is access to the extensive [library] of I-shaped rolled sectionswhich is accessible via the corresponding button. Among others, the following cross-sections are available for selection: I-profile series (I, IPE, IPEa, IPEo, IPEv, HE-B, HE-A, HE-M, HE-AA, etc.) If a welded cross-section is available, I-shaped, uniaxially symmetrical profiles can be defined using the button. Angular and U cross sections are possible as additional profiles. Like the cross-sectionsof the beams, they can be selected in the [Library] or defined with the button. There is already an interesting webinar on the subject of ""design of crane girders according to Eurocode 3"" on our homepage."
"Can the coefficient for the system strength ksys or the coefficient for considering the local load concentration km,loc be automatically taken into account when designing cross laminated timber with RF-LAMINATE?","An automatic consideration of the coefficients is not possible. However, you can take the coefficients into account directly in the layer structure by adjusting the strengths accordingly."
"I have a software license for RFEM and installed it on my laptop. I then transferred the license to my PC using ""Transfer software"". Now I want to use the license again on my laptop. However, RFEM now opens directly in the demo version. Is there a way to get the authorization back?","The license must be transferred again. About ""Help"" --> ""Authorization"" you can read in the license on the target computer again."
Internal forces are not displayed for result bars in my model. How can I change this?,"For result bars, you must ensure that the ""Results on result bars"" option is activated in the Show navigator. If this is deactivated, no internal forces are displayed. "
Can I put a network dongle (USB hardlock) into operation on a virtual server?,"Yes, in principle it is possible to use the hardlock via a USB adapter (such as MyUTN, SILEX,...) on the virtual server. However, we cannot provide support for this additional hardware."
Is it possible to carry out a Revit export without an RSTAB or RFEM license?,"This option also exists in Revit via the Dlubal export. For this it is necessary to install the trial version of Dlubal RFEM or RSTAB after installing Revit. The Dlubal Link now also appears in Revit, via which the export to an RSTAB or RFEM file is possible without requiring a license.In Revit should make sure that there is an analytical model that is intended for export."
Can bridge cranes including the endcarriages be calculated with KRANBAHN? Which profiles are used for trolley rails?,"With the CRANEWAY program, only the main girders can be verified, but not the bridge crane itself. The end beams of the bridge crane are also not verified.In the case of an overhead traveling crane, the parameters of the rail cross-section and an additional cross-section can be specified in the CRANEWAY mask 1.3. The width a and the height b must be defined for a flange. Beam cross-sections made of rolled or welded profiles can be combined with a rail or strap as desired. If the rail profile selected is too large or the girder profile is too small, the input can only be continued with a plausible crane runway girder profile.Angular and U-sections are possible as additional profiles. Like the cross-sections of the beams, they can be selected in the [Library] or defined with the button. You can find an interesting webinar on our website on the topic "" Design of crane runway girders according to Eurocode 3""."
Is it possible to change the font size in the result history window?,"In the settings for the result curves, it is also possible to change fonts and colors."
"In the RF-CONCRETE Surfaces module, I get an undesignability for the steel stress analysis in the serviceability limit state (SLS) and no values are output for the steel stresses. Message 239) is also output. Why is that?","According to EC2 specifications, the steel stress analysis in the SLS is only carried out with the characteristic combination. If no combination of the ""characteristic"" type is selected, the verification is not carried out. There are three ways to counter this: 1. Adding an additional characteristic type combination to select the combinations to be designed. 2. Changing the combination type of an already selected combination so that it is considered a distinctive combination. 3. Modify the specification of the standard and activate the check in the detail settings for other combination types (frequent or quasi-constant). "

How is the bond between the individual layers regulated in the RF-LAMINATE module?,"In general, the module assumes a rigid bond between the layers.Further information on calculation with the RF-LAMINATE module can also be found in the associated manual. The special features of the different material models (isotropic, orthotropic and hybrid) are also explained there."
I have defined several load cases and would also like to apply a constantly acting prestress as a member load. Which load case is the prestress ideally assigned to?,"At this point, it is recommended to create load combinations:First, a new load case ""Prestress"" must be created. The corresponding prestress should only be entered as a member load within this load case. The ""prestress"" category of action is considered to be constantly acting, just like self-weight, for example. This means that the prestressing load case is in contain all generated load combinations. "
Is it possible to represent an all-glass corner made of insulating glass in RFEM?,"Yes, you have to model the entire structure (sheaves, cavity and support) directly in RFEM. The disks can then be verified using the ""global calculation type"" in RF-Glas.The only difficulty here is that the loads from the climatic loads cannot be applied automatically, but have to be defined manually.The temporary model can be used as an aid to modelling."
"The spring stiffness of line supports is specified in kN/m², why?","In general, the unit of spring stiffness is given in kN/m. In addition, the line supports are always related to a length of one meter. This results in the unit kN/(m*m) and combined kN/m². "
I want to select a masonry type material in the material library. Why is the library in the Masonry category empty?," The property of the masonry material depends on a large number of input parameters. A list of all possible constellations would be very extensive. A material can be created using the ""Create new masonry type material..."" button. A material, once created, remains in the library for repeated use."
Can I calculate or design concrete-concrete composite cross-sections with RFEM?,"representation of a concrete-concrete composite cross-section is not yet possible. For this purpose, the construction status calculation must be coupled with the cross-section solver of the concrete design. We are currently working to ensure that this can be implemented in future versions."
It seems that the version RFEM 5.18.01 and Halfen HDB 13.21 are not compatible.In RF-PUNCH Pro I get the error message that the Halfen HDB design program cannot be found. But this is installed and registered with me. What can I do?,"In fact, there is unfortunately an inadequacy in the interface between Halfen HDB (Version 13.21) and RF-STANZ Pro (5.18.01). We have corrected this shortcoming with an update. You can find the download link for the update in the download area of your Dlubal account or directly by message from our hotline -Supports."
How do I get the largest column load in my RFEM 3D model?,"So that the internal forces determined can be used for the design, the following points should be taken into account: The model should represent the real building as precisely as possible. For this, materials, surface thicknesses, cross-sectional dimensions, joint definitions, support conditions, etc. must be correctly defined. The loads must be defined and applied in accordance with standards. The combinatorics can be automatically adopted by RFEM. In the case of internal forces from result combinations, the correct max/min values must be evaluated. The maximum compressive force in a column corresponds to the minimum normal force (min N)."
How can I create my own material?,"The material database is expandable. If a new material is added, it can be used across models.Click on the ""Create new material"" button in the library.The ""New Material"". The parameters of the entry selected in the ""Material to apply"" list are preset. Now adjust the values. It is therefore easier to create a new material if you first select a material with similar properties.User-defined materials are saved in the Materialien_User.dbd file. This is located in the RFEM master data folder (C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\RFEM 5.xx\General Data). You can save the file and, if necessary, transfer it to another computer."
Which time step should I choose for the calculation of the time history analysis in the RF‑/DYNAM Pro module?,"There are two choices available: an automatic time step selection and a manual one. Especially for a structure with non-linearities, it is always recommended to select the time step manually, since the automatic determination is only carried out using the defined accelerograms or time diagrams. For this, a time step convergence study should be performed, which compares the computation time and the accuracy.The time step to choose depends on many factors, including the excitation frequency, the frequency and the size of the structure, and the degree of nonlinearities. It is therefore not possible to make a general statement about the size of the time step.In order to achieve sufficient accuracy, the relevant period T = 1/f should be divided into around 20 steps, ie the time step Δt is to be chosen as follows:$\mathrm{Δt}\;<\frac{\mathrm T}{20}\;=\;\frac1{20\mathrm f}\;= \;\frac{\mathrm\pi}{10\mathrm\omega\;}$For transiently defined excitations, such as accelerograms or tabulated time diagrams, the shortest time segment should be divided into 7 steps:$\mathrm{Δt}\;=\;\frac{\mathrm{Min}\left\{{\mathrm t}_{\mathrm i+1}\right.-\;{\mathrm t}_{\mathrm i}\}\;}7$Independent of the calculation, time steps are given for saving the results."

"In SHAPE-THIN I have modeled a cross-section with point elements. However, these point elements are not displayed when importing the cross-section into RSTAB/RFEM. Why is that?","Point elements represent relatively small objects to represent irregularities in the cross-sectional geometry. They can be added as fillets, rectangles, circles or triangles or removed from element surfaces. In this way, the area of the point element can also be taken into account or excluded for the cross-section values. Point elements have no stress points, so that no stresses are determined on point elements . The point elements are therefore not relevant for the evaluation in the additional modules and are not output graphically. However, the point elements are taken into account in the cross-section values. An exception is the torsional moment of inertia, where the point elements are not taken into account in the standard setting of SHAPE-THIN. However, this can be compensated for in SHAPE-THIN in the Calculation parameters dialog via a correction coefficient. Alternatively, the torsional moment of inertia can be calculated using the FE method, which also includes the effect of point elements. "
How can I change the units for the required reinforcement in RF-CONCRETE Columns?I always see [m²] instead of [cm²].,"In the RF-CONCRETE Columns module, you can adjust the units via the Settings menu.To adjust the unit for the required reinforcement cross-section, change the unit for the ""Areas""."
The object snap is displayed with a distance from the snap point. What can be the reason and how can I fix it?,"The structure is probably far from zero (0, 0, 0). The structure should be moved to the zero point for the object snap to work as desired."

"want to define a nodal support that can be moved in X', but the selection is greyed out. Why is that?","If not all directions of the nodal support are freely selectable, you should check whether you have selected the 3D model type in the general data. In a 2D surface, certain directions of the bearing are locked. "
"When evaluating the results, it is noticeable that e.g. B. due to the temperature load cases, very high normal forces arise in some FE points. How can I model the surfaces so that no unrealistic effects arise?","If the stresses are concentrated at one FE point, this is in many cases a singularity. In this case, it is often sufficient to arrange smoothing areas at the corner points or singularity points. The stresses should then be significantly smaller in these areas.How to use Singularities and Smoothing areas there are also several articles in our knowledge base."
Why can't I see a color scale in the panel even though I have results?,"The following settings must be made to display the color scale:For member results: Activate the ""Colored with gradient"", ""Colored without gradient"" or ""Cross-sections"" option under ""Results"" → ""Staff"" in the Show navigator,For surface results: Activate the ""Isosurfaces"", ""Isolines"" or ""Differences"" option under ""Results"" → ""Display type"",For member and surface results: Selection of all or selected members/surfaces within the ""Filter"" tab in the panel"
"Although I have selected ""simultaneously"" as the effect for several load cases within an action category, load combinations that do not act simultaneously are also generated.","Simultaneous action does not mean that the load cases have to occur simultaneously, but can.If the loads are really always to act simultaneously, then they must the ""Alternative/simultaneously acting load cases"" function can also be used."
I would like to calculate a hall frame with loads from a crane runway. It's not entirely clear to me what the different impact categories mean. Can you explain these to me?,"In the EN 1991-3 standard, the load groups 1 to 10 are specified in Table 2.2. These are to be equated with the names of the classes in our software.The classification into categories A to E represents a Dlubal-specific classification.Category A: limit state of the Load capacity → Table 2.2 of the standard: ULS (1-7)Category B: Test load (8)Category C: Exceptional (9.10) Category D: Serviceability limit state (11-13)Category E: It was included in the combinatorics at the customer's request and should be used for load cases in which bearing forces from the crane runway girder calculation are combined in the subsequent construction.An article in our Knowledge Base (see Links below) refers to the fact that combinatorics (classes A to D) must be used for the preliminary design of crane runway girders . This combinatorics should not be used for the supporting construction (brackets, supports, beams).In your model, the bearing loads from the crane runway calculation would only be considered in category E."
How many soil samples do I have to define at least in RF-SOILIN to get realistic results?,"Basically, a soil sample is sufficient to determine the terrain model or the soil structure. However, if the layer thickness changes along the foundation body, further soil samples should of course be defined.The result of the soil structure can be displayed in the RFEM screen view."
"When importing a SCIA Engineer (*.xml) file, I get the error message that the definition file *.xml.def was not found.

"Can the ""Snow load zones, wind zones and earthquake zones"" online service also be controlled digitally via an API or a web service?","Yes, the online service ""Snow load zones, wind zones and earthquake zones"" offers a web service in the background for determining the site-specific loads without opening the website. The web service can be used for all load maps from the visible online service are and is controlled via a URL address. An external process (your application) sends a request URL address to our server (Dlubal) and receives the load information in CSV format as a result. In order for the process to work, the URL address must contain all the information required to define the load type, standard, geolocation, output language and user. The final URL is then composed of these building blocks.The load type and standard are defined using the ""map"" building block. The 1st part describes the load type (e.g. snow, wind or earthquake) and the 2nd part the standard (e.g. din-en-1991-1-3).→ map=snow-din-en-1991-1-3The geo-position is defined via the ""place"" or ""position"" module. The ""place"" option reacts like the search option in the visible online service. The geo-position is defined here using search terms, address, etc. The ""position"" option defines the geoposition using geocoordinates in the format[latitude in °, longitude in °].→ place=messe, düsseldorf→ position =51.2624991,6.735927199999992The output language of the results is defined via the ""language"" module. The language is defined via an abbreviation (de - German, en - English, etc.)→ language=deThe identity of the user is determined via the ""login"" and ""hash"" defined. The ""login"" component describes the user's e-mail address and the ""hash"" component describes a hidden password. For a functional login, the e-mail address must be stored in a valid Dlubal account. The associated ""hash"" module is specified in the Dlubal account under the heading ""My data"" - ""Identity of the online service"". → login=max.mustermann@test.com → hash=xyzA request URL can then be generated from these modules and sent to our server.→ https://external- crm.dlubal.com/loadzones/data.aspx?map=snow-din-en-1991-1-3&place=messe, düsseldorf&language=de&login=max.mustermann@test.com&hash=xyzWhen you send the requested load information is returned in CSV format from our server. To send the load queries to our server without restrictions a geo-zone tool package is required. Such a geo-zone tool package contains a certain contingent of load queries. The quota is reduced by one meter with each load query.→ https://www.dlubal.com/de/support-und-schulungen/service/geo-zonen-tool-for-load-determinationSince the web service charges the purchased contingent, careful handling with regard to data protection is necessary with the identity modules and the request URL. It is Z. B. to ensure that your program does not present the request URL with identity building blocks to an unauthorized third party. "
How can I check whether the cross-section modeled in SHAPE-THIN is connected?,"The model check for connected elements can be used to check whether the cross-section is connected.The function is called up via the Extras → Model check → Connected elements menu. Before the calculation, there is a message if the cross-section is not connected. "
The plastic stresses are not shown in SHAPE-THIN. What is the reason?,The plastic stresses are only displayed in the isosurfaces display type. The display type can be set using the icon in the toolbar or in the project navigator - Show under Results → Display type. 
"Is there a way to ""borrow"" licenses from the server?","No, unfortunately our current licensing system does not have a loan function - regardless of the physical (hardlock, USB copy protection device) or digital (softlock) software protection variant.In contrast to the physical variant, the digital software protection technology offers in addition, a ""rehost"" function for transferring the digital software protection system from one computer to another. However, this transfer does not mean a transfer of an individual license for a specific program from our product range, but of the entire licensing, which is regulated with the respective softlock. Transferring the digital software protection to another computer corresponds to plugging a physical protection plug into another computer."
"Is it also possible to model line supports in RSTAB, e.g. B. to simulate a linear foundation under a beam?","The ""Bedding"" function enables a member to be supported elastically over its entire length. This can be used, for example, to model foundation beams while capturing the subsoil properties. If the bedding is not effective for tensile or compressive stresses, the non-linear effects can be taken into account in the calculation."
Areas of some windows are cut off so that buttons or functions of the program cannot be reached. How to fix this?,"The dialogs in the Dlubal programs are optimized for the display size of 100% in the control panel. The problem can possibly be solved if the display size in the control panel is changed to 100% and/or a higher resolution is set. The solution could also be to disable scaling at high DPI -Create values. To do this, open the properties by right-clicking on the program icon. Under the Compatibility tab, check Override high DPI scaling behavior. Scaling performed by: and select Application from the drop-down box. Then accept the change and confirm with OK."
How can I determine the calculation time?,Information on the calculation time can be found in the Data.LOG file. This file is stored in the !SOLVER folder in the model's working directory. The working directory can be found in the program options.
"After importing the support loads using the ""Apply support reactions as loads"" function, I noticed discrepancies in the load sums: The loads in the new model are much larger!","On import, the support reactions are exported as free loads with fixed coordinates. For each of the free loads, you can specify the area on which it should act. As a rule, the ""All"" control field is activated when the load is accepted. This loads all surfaces that 'break through' these individual loads. So it can happen that some surfaces are unintentionally loaded. The result is a larger total load in the model.It is therefore advisable to specify the surfaces on which the load to be imported may be applied in the ""Apply support reactions as loads"" dialog.In the case of free loads, the surfaces on which the load is to act can also be adjusted later."
I get warning number 1145 when I try to calculate a file. What is the cause of this?,"The reason for this message is that you are in viewer mode. When installing RFEM or RSTAB, a viewer version is automatically installed in addition to the normal version. This appears as an additional icon on the desktop. In this mode, files with results can be opened, but no changes can be made. If you want to edit and calculate a file, you should use the icon without the addition ""Viewer"" open. "
How can I account for the throughput effect in the load generators?," The throughput effect can be recorded using correction factors. The input is to be made in the ""Assign correction factors to members"" dialog, which can be opened via the [Load correction factors] button."
"In the design module, a SHAPE-THIN cross-section is classified as an impermissible cross-section type and the design is therefore not possible. What is the reason?","The SHAPE-THIN cross-section may consist of several non-connected partial cross-sections, so that it is calculated in SHAPE-THIN according to the theory of stiffening systems. SHAPE-THIN also issues a corresponding note before the calculation. The design of such cross-sections is not possible in add-on modules such as RF-/STEEL EC3, RF-/ALUMINIUM, etc.In most cases, however, the cross-section parts should be connected to each other. The FAQ describes how this connection is modeled can be used.Furthermore, it is possible in SHAPE-THIN to define different materials for the individual cross-section parts. Material allocation for the individual cross-section parts is then possible in RSTAB/RFEM see FAQ. However, these hybrid cross-sections cannot be designed in the add-on modules such as RF-/STEEL EC3, RF-/ALUMINIUM, etc. "
Does this S-Class refer to the crane or the crane runway when specifying the load in mask 1.4?,"The 10 S classes (S0-S9) to be defined in mask 1.4 refer to the crane runway. It is not possible to enter the 12 S classes (S01, S02 and S0-S9) for cranes. There is already an interesting webinar on the topic ""Dimensioning of crane runway girders according to Eurocode 3"" on our homepage. "
Has the offset dimension or the anchorage length of the longitudinal reinforcement already been taken into account in the reinforcement proposal?,"In RF-CONCRETE Members (RFEM) or CONCRETE (RSTAB), the offset is taken into account by default when determining the reinforcement proposal. You can see the difference between the required reinforcement with and without an offset when Look at the results in the result navigator:- As,-z (top)- As,+z (bottom )- As,-z (top),req.- As,+z (bottom) ,req.Show. In As,-z (above),req. and As,+z (below),req. the offset is included. The anchorage length for a ""straight bar"" is taken into account by default in the reinforcement proposal in RF-CONCRETE Members or CONCRETE. You can find the setting for this in input mask 1.6. The anchorage length is measured from As,-z (top), erf. and As,+z (below),erf. determined. So the offset is also included here."
Can I use RF-FOUNDATION Pro to calculate the spring stiffness of the foundation slab and use it in RFEM?,"Yes, this is possible. To do this, activate the calculation of settlement in RF-/FOUNDATION Pro. A calculation as ""rigid plate"" is required for the export of the spring stiffnesses. You can specify this in the settings for the settlement calculation.After the calculation, the option to export is available via the ""File"" menu in RF-/FOUNDATION Pro .The export of the stiffnesses is possible in RFEM and RSTAB."
"For the load combinations, the load case numbers (LC1, LC2, LC3, ...) are not displayed, but the action categories (G, Qw, Qs, Imp). Where can I set this?","You will find the corresponding setting in the program options in the ""Program"" tab: Uncheck ""Name the combination according to the action category"" so that the load case numbers are displayed for the LCs."
"When you click on a sheet or graphic, the protocol always loads for a few seconds. In addition, the document is rebuilt with almost every click. How can I prevent this?","If you want to move graphics or delete, add or change chapters, you should disable the Instant update of the preview."
"I modeled a contact solid with objects connecting to it at different locations on either side. The error message ""Error generating the FE mesh!"" appears.","In this case, the following conditions must be met to generate the FE mesh:The two contact surfaces must be modeled in parallel: All nodes, lines and integrated objects must match, even if an object has no use on one of the contact surfaces. So that an FE mesh can also be generated, taking into account any objects that may not be used, is within the FE mesh settings to activate the option ""Integrate unused objects into the surfaces"". "
"I want to export the nodal support forces of multiple load cases, load and result combinations to an Excel spreadsheet. How do I proceed?","The node support forces can be exported in Table 4.1 ""Nodes - Support Forces"" (RFEM) or 4.4 ""Nodes - Support Forces"" (RSTAB) using the [Export/Import of Table] button.Under ""Results for LC/LC/EK"" you can select whether the currently set load case or the current combination, all or only certain load cases, load and result combinations should be exported.

A moment curve in STEEL warping torsion breaks through or has a sign change from one x-point to the next. What could be the reason?,"In RF-/STEEL Warping Torsion, the imperfection is applied in both directions (+/-). Thus, the + imperfection can be decisive at an x-position, while the - imperfection is decisive at the neighboring x-position. The decisive result is shown in the result tables and in the graphic. This could be the cause of the described effect."
The results from STAHL warping torsion seem much too large to me. What could be the reason?,"Please check the boundary conditions, i.e. the definition of the nodal supports and in particular the imperfection approach in window 1.13 ""Parameters - Sets of Members"". The imperfection defaults to L/150, which can be a conservative solution."
"I would like to calculate warping torsion with influence from second-order theory, but without imperfection. How does this work?","In order to carry out the calculation without imperfections, activate the ""L manual"" check box and leave the length at 0.00 meters."
When using plastic material according to theory II. or III. Calculate order?,"No, when using a non-linear material model it is not absolutely necessary to calculate according to the second or third order theory. The material non-linearity is also taken into account in the calculation according to the 1st order theory.The calculation according to the 2nd or 3rd order theory means that the equilibrium is set up on the deformed system. It is therefore a geometric non-linearity.The difference between the 2nd and 3rd orders is that with 3rd orders, large torsions can also occur.If i.e. there is no stability problem or the stability problem is investigated elsewhere, the first order calculation is sufficient."
Can I view the bearing forces from the STAHL warping torsion calculation?,"Unfortunately, it is not possible to output these bearing forces. However, you can carry out a design with RF-/FE-LTB: It contains the output of the support forces."
"I design a simply symmetrical cross-section (T-profile) and get the message ""Undesignable: ER056) The general procedure can only be used for I-cross-sections"". Why?","Since the method according to 6.3.3 EN 1993-1-1 can only be used for components with bending and compression for doubly symmetrical cross-sections, the add-on module verifies these components using the general method according to 6.3.4 EN 1993-1-1 . This method can be used for any simply symmetrical cross-sections. In Germany, however, only I-sections are permitted, which is why the warning appears here.You can carry out a stability analysis according to the second order theory as a cross-section analysis, which can be carried out with the additional modules RF-/FE-LTB or RF -/STEEL warping torsion is possible.Alternatively, you can also allow the general method for non-I cross-sections in the ""National Annex"" dialog, but this deviates from the National Annex."
"am designing an unsymmetric cross-section and get the message ""Undesignable: ER051 moment about z-axis on unsymmetric cross-section, haunched bar or set of members"". Why?","The reason for this warning is that unsymmetrical cross-sections cannot be verified using the methods mentioned in 6.3.3 EN 1993-1-1 or the general method according to 6.3.4 EN 1993-1-1. You can perform a second-order stability analysis as a cross-section analysis, which is possible with the additional modules FE-LTB or STAHL warping torsion."
"I am designing a set of members with a uniform doubly symmetrical cross-section and I get the warning ""Undesignable: ER051 moment about axis z on non-symmetrical cross-section, haunched bar or set of members"". Why?","The reason for this warning is that sets of members are checked by default according to the General Method 6.3.4 of EN 1993-1-1. However, this method is only approved for stresses in the load-bearing plane, i.e. without transverse bending moments. This is why the corresponding warning appears.You can carry out a second-order stability analysis as a cross-section analysis, which is possible with the add-on modules RF-/FE-LTB or RF-/STEEL Warping Torsion.Alternatively, you can ignore the transverse bending in the filter options of the ""Details"" dialog, ""Stability"" tab or activate the extended Naumes method in the ""National Annex"" dialog, which enables transverse bending. It is up to the user to use the two options mentioned.The best option in this case, however, is to use the Replacement member method for in the ""Details"" dialog, ""Stability"" tab select the design of the sets of members."
"am designing a haunched beam and I get the message ""Undesignable: ER051 moment about axis z on non-symmetrical cross-section, haunched bar or set of bars"". Why?","The reason for the warning is that haunched cross-sections cannot be verified using method 6.3.3 of EN 1993-1-1. The RF-/STEEL EC3 module designs these cross-sections using the General Method 6.3.4 of EN 1993-1-1. However, this method is only approved for stresses in the load-bearing plane, i.e. without transverse bending moments. This is why the warning appears.You can perform a second-order stability analysis as a cross-section analysis, which is possible with the add-on modules RF-/FE-LTB or RF-/STEEL Warping Torsion.Alternatively, you can ignore the transverse bending in the filter options of the ""Details"" dialog, ""Stability"" tab or activate the extended Naumes method in the ""National Annex"" dialog, which enables transverse bending."
What is the difference between RF-/FE-LTB and RF-/STEEL warping torsion? Both calculate with the 7th degree of freedom.,"That's right, both add-on modules calculate with the 7th degree of freedom, warping. The difference is that in RF-/FE-LTB only those loads are automatically recognized that are directly on the Set of members act. Loads from other components that have an indirect effect on the set of design members must be added manually as additional loads. A complete recalculation of the system then takes place in RF-/FE-LTB.RF-/STEEL Warping Torsion, on the other hand, analyzes the internal force curves from the calculation of the main program and then recalculates the loads. These are then recalculated and recalculated. This eliminates the need to enter the load, which saves time."
How can I change the consequential damage class according to Annex B3 of EN 1990 for the automatic load combination?,You can specify the consequential damage class (SFK) in the settings of the national annex in the basic data of the model (Edit → Model data → Basic data).
"In the results window 2.1 ""Punching Verifications"" I get error no. 56 ""The FE mesh is not fine enough"". How can I set the network?","Depending on the selected type of load determination, RF-PUNCH Pro determines the punching load from the shear forces in the critical perimeter. The surface internal forces from the RFEM model are used here.If the FE mesh in the area of the punching node is not fine enough, this can lead to inaccurate results. In this case, you receive message no. 56 in window 2.1.To avoid the problem, you should carry out a FE mesh refinement in the area of the punching node in the RFEM model. You can arrange them either directly at the node or at the adjoining lines of the wall ends or wall corners.If a sufficiently fine FE mesh refinement has been created, the warning message disappears automatically after a recalculation in RF-PUNCH Pro."
I received an RSTAB file with the file extension .rs8t or an RFEM file with the file extension .rf5t and I cannot open it. What should I do?,Files with the file extension .rs8t or .rf5t were created with the test version of RSTAB or RFEM created. These files are tied to the computer they were created on and can therefore only be opened on that computer.Please note that commercial use of the trial version is not permitted.
"The higher the basic reinforcement is defined in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces, the greater the required reinforcement determined by the module. Why is that?","In the module there are options for the reinforcement to be considered for the shear force analysis. The applied longitudinal reinforcement has an influence on the shear force capacity VRd,c. The options can be used to specify which longitudinal reinforcement is to be used for the shear force analysis. The shear force verification can be carried out using the following reinforcement:Required reinforcement by calculationMaximum value from required or existing reinforcementAutomatic increase of the longitudinal reinforcement so that Shear reinforcement is avoidedIf, for example, the second option is selected and a shear reinforcement can be avoided with the basic reinforcement, the basic reinforcement is selected and output as required."
"What does the ""R"" stand for in RFEM and RSTAB? ","The letter R in the program names RFEM and RSTAB stands for ""spatial"". What is meant is the possibility of calculating 3D models (spatially) using the finite element method or as frameworks."
"What is the difference between LW and LT in window 1.5 ""Effective lengths - Members"" and 1.6 ""Effective lengths - Sets of members""?","The length LT represents the buckling length for torsional and lateral-torsional buckling under planned centric compression. The length LT works analogously to columns D and G: A torsional buckling and Lateral-torsional buckling load calculated for the design of a pure compressive force according to EN 1993-1-1, paragraph 6.3.1.4. The length LW, on the other hand, is not a buckling length, but the length to which the moment and shear force progression with the boundary conditions kz and kw (columns J and K) as well as the lateral intermediate supports. As a rule, this length should not be changed."
Does RSBUCK consider the stability problem of lateral torsional buckling?,No. No stability analyzes for lateral torsional buckling are performed in the RSBUCK add-on module.
"What does the ""Also use the selected method for the calculation of all supported cross-section types"" option do in RF‑/STEEL Plasticity?","This check box activates, for example, the use of the simplex method for I-profiles that are otherwise automatically dimensioned using the partial internal force method including redistribution.If the check box is deactivated, the simplex method or the partial internal force method (depending on after selection) is only used if a general cross-section (e.g. from SHAPE-THIN) is available."
Is it possible to print several color scales side by side?,"If you display member and surface results on the screen at the same time, only one panel is displayed. However, you can switch back and forth between members and surfaces.When printing the graphic, you can specify how the two panels are to be displayed in the report."
My cross section is classified in cross section class 1. Are plastic hinges now automatically taken into account?,"No, plastic hinges must be defined separately in the model. They are not generated automatically by RF-/STEEL EC3."
Where do I define an eccentricity of the load in RF-/FE-LTB?,"In window 2.2 ""Member loads"" you can define the eccentricity of the load by scrolling to the right in the table.You can also use a button to graphically select stress points of the cross-section and thus determine the eccentricity based on the Define cross section (see picture)."
"When inserting blocks, the previously defined sets of members are not adopted. How do I ensure that the sets of members are also inserted?","The sets of members are inserted when the ""Sets of members"" check box is activated in the detailed settings. "
"When generating loads with different arrangements of members within the load plane, I get wrong load values. Why isn't the load distributed correctly?","Do you have e.g. B. a grating with different grid distances in some areas, the approach of the load generator with only one defined area load level is not suitable. Otherwise, the load would be determined according to the size of the area load plane and applied to all members (except for the edge members) with the same load size.However, if the area load is divided into several sections (dialog section "" delimitation of the distributed load level""), the load is distributed correctly."
Where can I find the connection moments from the applied rotational restraint in RF-/STEEL EC3?,The connection moments are not calculated in RF-/STEEL EC3.
Are the buckling length coefficients in the add-on modules for aluminum and steel design automatically determined from the model or do I have to make adjustments?,All buckling length factors are preset to 1.0 by default. The coefficients are not calculated using the model. The buckling length coefficients must be adjusted manually for the design or can be imported from the add-on modules RSBUCK or RF-STABILITY. 
Are the boundary conditions from RFEM/RSTAB taken over when calculating with RF-/STEEL Warping Torsion or the General Method in RF-/STEEL EC3?,"The nodal supports and boundary conditions are preset but not adopted. They usually have to be adjusted.For the general procedure for the set of members design in RF-/STEEL EC3, a nodal support phi_x' and u_y' is predefined at the start and end of the set of members, which represents a forked support for all straight sets of members .In RF-/STEEL Warping Torsion, a nodal support u_x, u_y, u_z and phi_x is predefined at the start and end of the set of members."
"The design is not successful in either RF-/STEEL or RF-/STEEL EC3. The warning ""Maximum possible thickness of material exceeded"" appears in RF‑/STEEL EC3. What should I do?","A thickness is stored in one or more stress points of the cross-section that is not covered by the material properties. The add-on modules can therefore not use a yield point for the design and a warning follows.Please select a different material that covers the thickness range, or change the thickness range of the existing material."
How do I manually give a member a precamber as an imperfection?,"An imperfection can be entered manually either via the ""New imperfection graphically"" button or via the menu ""Insert → Loads → Imperfections"".This precamber should not be confused with a Forced pre-cambering, in which, depending on the support condition of the member, bending moments can arise simply by entering the curvature. The load direction in the ""Member Load"" dialog is to be understood as a curvature around the corresponding axis (y or z) analogous to a moment.In this way, internal forces and deformations in the case of a pre-curvature are displayed as a member load ( forced precamber) is always taken into account, while a precamber as an imperfection only provides internal forces and deformations if there is a normal force from another loading in the imperfect member.The RF-IMP/RS-IMP."
Why do bars running close to each other connect in the calculation?,"The program interprets the entered model for the calculation in an FE mesh. This mesh depends on the shape parameters set in the ""FE Mesh"" dialog.To correct any modeling inaccuracies, there is a parameter ε in the FE mesh settings. In a figurative sense, it regulates the maximum distance between the FE nodes. If the distance between the elements/nodes in the model is smaller than the parameter ε, the FE nodes are combined. This combination then results in the described ""merging"" of the bars in the calculation.You can circumvent this effect and simulate the bars independently by setting the parameter ε smaller than the existing distance."
Is it possible to place the designation of the cross-sections and materials in the middle of the member?,"You can set the relative position of the member information in the display properties.Select the category ""Model data → Members → Members with member type beam member"" on the left.Specify the category in the middle part of the dialog under ""Numbering"", e.g. ""Cross-sections"".Then click on the button [123] 'Edit locations of the line or member information' at the bottom right.In the following dialog you can then edit the relative positions of the bar information. Entering e.g. B. 0.50 means that the cross-section designation is placed in the middle of the member."
I always design all members and sets of members in a single design case. Is this procedure correct or are there problems?,"Members that are also contained in sets of members should not be selected in parallel with the design. This leads to double entries, e.g. ""Effective lengths - Members"" and ""Effective lengths - Sets of members"" or for nodal supports.During the design, the maximum result for both entries is then determined and only this result appears in the result tables. This makes it difficult to control and understand which inputs these results come from. Therefore, it is not recommended to analyze all members and sets of members in a single design case. Instead, several design cases should be created in which the components are divided."
"When creating the printout report, my model appears on the cover sheet. Can I change the picture afterwards?","You can change the cover image by right-clicking the image and selecting ""Edit"" from the context menu. This takes you to the working window of the main program. There you can change the view, numbering or add loads and results.When you return to the printout report, the graphics on the cover sheet are updated."
Why do I need the RF-CONCRETE NL add-on module for the stability analysis in RF-CONCRETE Members? Paragraph 5.8.6 of EC 2 only speaks of a geometric non-linearity.,"For the stability analysis of compression members, you need the combination of RF-CONCRETE Members and RF-CONCRETE NL. The reason is as follows:First, the internal forces of the individual load combinations (Th. II. Order + Imp) are calculated linear-elastic. Basically, you only need RFEM for this.The cross-section check is then carried out in RF-CONCRETE Members with these internal forces determined linearly and a required bending reinforcement is determined from these internal forces.This bending reinforcement is used then compared with the input provided by the user regarding the existing basic reinforcement or minimum reinforcement and from this a reinforcement proposal (module dialog ""3.1 Existing longitudinal reinforcement"") is generated.This existing longitudinal reinforcement is then used for the non-linear design.According to Section 5.8.6(1), geometric non-linearities according to the second-order theory must be taken into account. However, the general rules for non-linear methods according to 5.7 also apply.In paragraph 5.7(1) ""non-linearities of the building materials must be adequately taken into account"". According to 5.7(4)P, non-linear methods must use building material properties that lead to a realistic stiffness and that take into account the uncertainties in the event of failure.The RF-CONCRETE NL add-on module is required for this. Accordingly, the geometric and material non-linearities are taken into account and the requirements of EC2 in relation to the verification in the ultimate limit state are met.Analogously, this method is also available in RSTAB in the add-on module CONCRETE."
Why is the influence of profile deformation on rotational restraint grayed out?,"The portion of section deformation can only be calculated for constant I-section members, not for haunched members or non-I sections."
"I have a sandwich panel and want to use it to stabilize a beam. However, there are only trapezoidal sheets or purlins to choose from. What can I do?","You can calculate the rotational restraint manually or with a program. Then enter the resulting value in the ""Settings"" table as stiffness C_D. To do this, set the rotational restraint type to ""Define manually""."
I am calculating a stick model and have warping torsion enabled. Why is the warping force analysis not carried out?,"Please check whether you have selected Sets of members for the design in the general data: The RF-/STEEL Warping Torsion module extension is only possible for a set of members design, not for members."
How can I change the buckling line of a cross section?,"You can adjust the buckling line directly in window 1.3 ""Cross Sections""."
I have a profile where local buckling is negligible. Can I classify the cross-section manually and thus bypass cross-section class 4?,"Manual cross-section classification is possible in window 1.3 ""Cross-Sections"".Cross-section classes 3 and 4 are available for general cross-sections, and all cross-section classes 1 to 4 for many common profiles."
"I get the message ""torsion on cross-section class 4"". Why does it appear and what can I do?","Torsion at cross-section class 4 is not regulated in Eurocode 3, which is why this warning message appears.You can change the cross-section, manually classify the cross-section to cross-section class 3 in window 1.3 or the torsion in the ""Details"" dialog , Neglect the ""Load capacity"" tab at your own discretion and under your own responsibility."
"I get the message ""Torsion present -> no proof of stability possible"". Why does it appear and what can I do?","This warning appears because no torsion is taken into account in the Eurocode replacement bar verifications. You can either use the torsion at your own discretion and under your own responsibility neglect the limit value in the ""Details"" dialog, ""Stability"" tab. Alternatively, carry out the stability analysis for open cross-sections according to the second-order theory (incl. consideration warping) with RF-/STEEL warping torsion or RF-/FE-LTB (see links below). "
I have imported a SHAPE-THIN profile and calculated it with STAHL EC3. Why is the cross-section not plastically designed?,"Only one elastic design can be carried out in RF-/STEEL EC3 for general cross-sections, including SHAPE-THIN profiles: the plastic interactions can only be applied to a few cross-section shapes."
Why is the increase in the material coefficient epsilon grayed out in the load capacity details?,"According to EN 1993-1-1, an increase in the material coefficient based on the acting stresses is only possible if the stability verifications not are carried out with equivalent member verifications. The option is greyed out because the substitute bar checks are activated by default in the following ""Stability"" tab.If you deactivate the substitute bar checks, the check box is unlocked and activated by default."
"design according to the general method 6.3.4 EN 1993-1-1 and have activated the addition ""Extended method according to Naumes"". The branch score alpha*crit is shown in red. Should I be worried?","No. If the alpha*crit value (the bifurcation value without torsional stiffness) is displayed in red and is therefore ""0"", there is no reduction in the imperfection coefficient (European lateral-torsional buckling curve). The initial value of the imperfection coefficient is used."
"Are there recommendations or literature and standard references for the settings of the ""Limit values for stability analysis"" in the details of RF-/STEEL EC3?","The filter functions in the ""Details"" dialog, ""Stability"" tab should make it possible to ignore small moments or compressive forces and thus e.g. For example, in the case of asymmetrical cross-sections, the buckling analysis can be carried out while neglecting the interaction between bending and compression. Otherwise the warning would appear that no proof of stability is possible.The application and setting of the limit values is at the discretion of the user and usually has to be agreed with the inspector. Dlubal Software cannot give any general recommendations. In the case of very slim components, however, it can make sense to reduce the limit values to 0%."
"The calculation in STEEL EC3 according to the general method or according to the warping torsion analysis is unsuccessful. Unfortunately, I can't check the eigenform graphically. Why?","For the representation of the mode shape, the calculation must be carried out successfully. If this is not possible, either the boundary conditions are incorrect or no stability problem was found (convergence not achieved). Then no branching form can be considered."
Can I understand and control the branch value calculated by the internal eigenvalue solver?,"Using the ""Eigenform - Overview"" window, it is possible to check the plausibility of the eigenvalue calculation. The graphical control option for the mode shape graphic is available if the eigenvalue solver was used in the calculation, e.g. B. when designing according to the general method according to EN 1993-1-1."
How can I activate and deactivate the transparent display of values on areas for graphics in the printout report?,"Right-clicking on one of the values takes you directly to the setting you are looking for in the context menu via ""Display properties"": ""Results → Result values → Result values on surfaces"". There you can make settings such as transparent or colored display of the values and specify the background color of the values in the two tabs ""Screen"" and ""Printout report""."
I want to consider hole weakening for tension checks at member ends. Where can I define the net area for tensile verifications?,"In the input masks 1.12 ""Parameters - Members"" and 1.13 ""Parameters - Sets of Members"" you can specify the net cross-sectional areas for tension checks according to EN 1993-1-1."
"When designing with STEEL warping torsion, I get tensile forces instead of compressive forces in a column. Where is the problem?","Check the preset supports in warping torsion: The supports hold the respective set of members at the start and end node in the local x-direction. The support ""hangs"" in the upper bearing and a tensile force is calculated and no stability problem may be found.Release the bearing at the head of the support in the local x-direction."
Is it possible to use individual verifications in design modules such as e.g. E.g. STEEL EC3 or ALUMINUM?,"Individual verifications such as bending and compression according to Section 6.3.3 EN 1993-1-1 cannot be deactivated. For a successful design, all required proofs must be fulfilled."
"In RF-/STEEL EC3 I have activated gamma_M1 for the calculation of the cross-section resistance, because I want to cover stability analyzes with second-order theory and imperfections. However, the cross-section verification for my design in Germany is carried out with 1.0. Why?","Probably you have not selected the correct national annex in the general data of the module. If, for example, measurement is based on ""CEN"", the recommendations of the standard are used and gamma_M1 is therefore set at 1.0.Please select the correct national appendix."
Can I enter an overburden in RF-MOVE Surfaces over which the load distribution width of the concentrated loads is automatically taken into account?,"If you apply a moving load from the load model library, you can specify a ""Thickness of the load-distributing layer"" and the ""Load propagation angle"" there. With these inputs, RF-MOVE Surfaces determines the length and width of the rectangular surfaces and generates free surface loads.If you have alternatively entered concentrated loads as moving loads, you can right-click on the free concentrated load and use the context menu in convert a distributed load. Parameters for controlling the load width are also available to you."
Where can I adjust the brightness of the hidden objects in the printout report? These colors are a bit too strong for me.,"You can control the intensity of the inactive objects in the program options under the ""Graphics"" tab."
"In the RF-STAGES module I get a message about an instability. In RFEM, the model calculates without any problems. How can the issue be resolved?","Basically, the following points must be observed:Entering the modelThe structure in RF-STAGES and RFEM can change based on the definition in RF - STAGES differ. This means that the structure in RF-STAGES can be different from that in RFEM. In order to find an instability in this regard in a certain construction stage, you would have to map the model in this construction stage in RFEM and consider it separately. In this context, it should also be noted that the inputs between RFEM and RF-STAGES are not synchronized. For example, a member end hinge removed in RFEM is not automatically removed in the RF-STAGES model. You must also ensure that the self-weight acts in the same direction in both RFEM and RF-STAGES. This can be checked and adjusted in RF-STAGES under ""Details"" → ""Calculations"" → ""Self-weight"".Calculation theoryRF-STAGES calculates for the permanent load cases basically according to theory III. Order. Due to this calculation theory, instabilities can occur which, for example, do not exist in a load case when calculating according to the first-order theory (critical load problems).Special structural elements Some of the structure elements available in RFEM are not supported in RF-STAGES. In certain cases, these structural elements can also be the reason for instability. The following structural elements are not fully supported in RF-STAGES:Line hingesBedding of membersSets of membersIntersections Node approvalsLine approvalsArea approvalsNode couplings"
"When designing with RF-CONCRETE Members, I get error 2212: ""Unsupported rib"". How can I do the calculation?","The following points must be observed for the correct design of ribs:The local z-axis of the rib must be parallel to the local z-axis of the surface. The local z-axis of the rib must be orthogonal to the xy surface plane.The surface type of the connected surface must be a plane.The cross-section type of the rib bar must be a rectangle. li>In the case of continuous members, there must be a uniform rib type for the entire set of members.The material of the rib must be identical to the material of the surface."
Is it possible to model a flexible composite girder using members in RFEM with a line release?,"Yes, this possibility exists. It is important to ensure that initially only one girder is modeled, the lines of which are released with a line release. You then add another member to the automatically generated copies of the lines. In the case of split beams, make sure that both members connected to the node are released in the line release table. In the downloads below you will find an example of a wood-concrete composite floor from [1] as a calculated model. If a bar with the material ""concrete"" is used, then it is towards it Make sure that the function is deactivated in the FE mesh settings. The division for the nonlinear reinforced concrete calculation is not compatible with the line releases."
I would like to include the formulas for the design in the STAHL EC3 printout. How does this work?,"In the printout report, you have the option of activating intermediate results. There it is also possible to select the verification formula (""design equation"")."
Can I change the stiffness of a surface from its plane?,"The stiffness of a surface can be influenced both in and out of its plane. For this, orthotropic stiffnesses are to be used."
I get an error message that my profile library was not found or is corrupt. What can I do?,"The profile library file is named ProfileDB.ADB. By default, it is located in the ""C:\Program Files\Dlubal\RFEM 5.xx"" or ""C:\Program Files\Dlubal\RSTAB 8.xx"" folder. If the file is damaged or blocked ( e.g. from the virus scanner), the error shown in the picture is displayed. In this case, we recommend adjusting the filter settings of the virus scanner.Alternatively, a new installation can be carried out. You will be asked whether you want to uninstall first. Confirm this query and then reinstall the program with administrator rights and, if necessary, temporarily switched off the virus scanner.In rare cases, the cause can also be missing Windows updates. Therefore, check for and install operating system updates."
"The error message ""Insufficient memory"" occurs during calculation, although the computer has sufficient RAM. Why is that?","The 32-bit solver is selected in the calculation parameters. You probably used an older file as a template. The 32-bit solver can use a maximum of 2 GB of RAM, no matter how much RAM the computer actually has.If you select the 64-bit solver, the calculation will run smoothly."
Can I also generate a wind load on roof overhangs with the load generator?,"If the load generator is used to generate wind loads quickly and easily, e.g. For example, for a hall with roof overhangs, the load on the roof overhang must be taken into account. The basic geometry of the building (without roof overhang) and the roof geometry (with roof overhang) are entered separately. The program determines the roof overhang from the difference and applies the load accordingly."
Can I export the critical perimeter from RF-PUNCH Pro to the RFEM model?,"Yes. You can export the critical perimeter from RF-PUNCH Pro to the RFEM model as a line. This is possible for all punching shapes (column, wall end and wall corner). The corresponding button can be found in the results window 2.1 ""Punching Verifications"".The RFEM model then shows a line at which e.g. B. a ""section"" can be created for further analysis. Note that the line must be integrated into the FE mesh of the surface. You can find the setting for this in the general FE mesh settings."
Can I also design a component made of stainless steel with RF-/STEEL EC3?,"Yes, stainless steels can be designed according to EN 1993-1-4:2006 (stainless steel) with the add-on module RF-/STEEL EC3. The partial safety factors, imperfection factors, etc. for stainless steels can be adjusted in the additional module for the parameters of the national annex."
Is it worth using the statics software RSTAB or RFEM for continuous beam calculations?,"Even simple structures such as continuous beams or 2D frames can be modeled, calculated and designed according to various standards quickly and effectively with RSTAB and RFEM. The various model generators are particularly recommended for such models. After entering the cross-section parameters, loads and geometry details, the model is automatically created by the model generator including the load cases (see video file)."
I seem to have successfully exported a DXF file including isolines/isosurfaces of the current results. But why are no isolines/isosurfaces visible on the system after the import into AutoCAD?,"For the successful export/import of a DXF file including isolines/isosurfaces, the following requirements must be observed:Activation of the option ASCII format - results Export the corresponding surfaces and activate the export of isolines/isosurfaces/trajectories in the ""Results - Isolines"" tab /isosurfaces (.dxf)"" "
Can 3D models created in RFEM be imported into the CAD program Nemetschek Allplan as 3D solids (e.g. via IFC)? If yes how?,"Unfortunately, the CAD data from RFEM and RSTAB cannot be exported directly to Nemetschek Allplan. The only option here is a DXF export.However, the RFEM surface results of the required reinforcement can be exported. You can then use them in Allplan to help you create reinforcement plans."
"In RFEM/RSTAB I have changed the cross-section properties of a cross-section or reduced the stiffness of a member. After the recalculation, the deformation of the system has adapted to the new cross-section values. However, these changes are not taken into account in the dimensioning in the additional modules.","The modified cross-section values are generally not used in the additional modules such as e.g. B. RF-/STEEL or RF-/STEEL EC3. They are only used to calculate the internal forces.In the additional modules, the stresses are calculated using the real cross-section dimensions, which cannot be modified. This would be difficult to implement, since the element width or element height is required for many designs and it is not known exactly which parameter was reduced due to the modification. This is e.g. This is important, for example, for the c/t designs in RF-/STEEL EC3."
"On my model, I get error 414 on a contact volume. No calculation can be performed.",The message states that the lines of the contact surfaces are not parallel. It is therefore advisable to check the nodes of the contact surfaces again and to check whether the lines are really exactly parallel to each other.
"Although my dongle is connected to the PC, I get an error message when the program starts. What is the reason?","Check whether the signal lamp on the dongle is lit. If it doesn't light up, try a different USB port, preferably directly on the mainboard and not on a USB hub or the front of the computer.If the light doesn't light up there either, insert one Test on another PC on which RFEM 5 or RSTAB 8 or your desired product is installed. If the result is as before, the dongle is most likely defective and needs to be replaced.If the error message occurs despite a lit signal light, please make sure you are using the most recent authorization file.If you cannot solve the problem, please send us a screenshot of the error message, a short description of the problem as well as the diagnostic file, which you can generate via the ""Help"" program menu."
How is the torsional restraint stiffness determined in RF-/STEEL EC3 for non-continuous torsional restraints (e.g. purlins)?,"The total torsional spring consists of several individual torsional springs, which are given in [2] as Equation 10.11.In the case of non-continuous torsional restraint by purlins, the torsional restraint in RF-/STEEL EC3 is calculated from the connection stiffness C D,A , the torsional restraint CD,C from the bending stiffness of the purlins on top, as well as the torsional restraint CD,B when activated from profile deformation taken into account.Because the design of the connection is unknown, an infinitely large value is set here by default. The spring stiffness is taken into account as a reciprocal value 1/C, so ""infinity"" results in a spring stiffness = 0. If the user knows the torsional spring stiffness of the connection, he can enter this value manually.Determining the torsional restraint C D,C from the flexural stiffness is calculated using the following formula:${\mathrm c}_{\mathrm D,\mathrm C}={\mathrm C}_{\mathrm D,\mathrm C}/\mathrm e\\{\mathrm C}_{\mathrm D,\mathrm C}=\frac{\mathrm k\cdot \mathrm E\cdot \mathrm I}{\mathrm s} \\$These are:E = Young's modulus k = coefficient for position (inner field, outer field) I = moment of inertia Iy s = spacing of the ledgers e = spacing of the purlinsThe rotational restraint CD,B from profile deformation is determined using the following formula, see [3] and [4] :${\mathrm c}_{\mathrm D,\mathrm B}={\mathrm C}_{\mathrm D,\mathrm B}/\ mathrm e\\{\mathrm C}_{\mathrm D,\mathrm B}=\sqrt{\mathrm E\cdot{\mathrm t}_{\mathrm w}^3\cdot\mathrm G\cdot{\ mathrm I}_{\mathrm T,\mathrm G}/\left(\mathrm h-{\mathrm t}_{\mathrm f}\right)}\\{\mathrm I}_{\mathrm T,\ mathrm S}=\left(\mathrm h-{\mathrm t}_{\mathrm f}\right)\cdot{\mathrm t}_{\mathrm w}^3/3\\{\mathrm I}_ {\mathrm T,\mathrm G}=\left({\mathrm I}_{\mathrm T}-{\mathrm I}_{\mathrm T,\mathrm S}\right)/2$ These are:E = modulus of elasticity tw = web thickness of truss or supported component G = G modulus h = Height of the truss or supported component tf = flange thickness of the truss b = width of truss e = spacing of the purlinsIn the attached example are respectively two design cases available.Case 1 was designed without considering the profile deformation. The total torsional spring is CD = CD,C = 4729 kNm/mCase 2 was calculated taking into account the Measure profile deformation. The total spring is CD = 72.02 kNm/mIndividual spring CD,B = 73, 14 kNm/m Individual spring CD,C = 4729 kNm/mTotal spring:$\begin{array}{l}\ frac1{{\mathrm C}_{\mathrm D}}=\frac1{{\mathrm C}_{\mathrm D,\mathrm B}}+\frac1{{\mathrm C}_{\mathrm D,\ mathrm C}}\;=\;\frac1{73.14}+\frac1{4729}\\{\mathrm C}_{\mathrm D}\;=72.02\;\mathrm{kNm}/\ mathrm m\end{array}$"
"want to superimpose two moving loads: moving load 1 remains at position 0.0 m and moving load 2 runs once over the entire beam. After that, moving load 1 remains at 0.2 m and moving load 2 runs over the beam again. Is this possible?","These load positions can be generated with the module RSMOVE or RF-MOVE: In the model file in the Downloads, two cases of moving loads (crane A and crane B) were identified. There are 50 load cases for moving loads alone.The load cases are then automatically combined. In the ""Actions"" tab, the effects of the load cases on each other can be specified. For this purpose, the load cases for crane A are assigned to group 1, the load cases for crane B to group 2. This means that all combinations of crane A are mutually exclusive. The same applies to crane B. However, the load cases of crane A can be combined with the load cases of crane B.You can find more information on moving loads and the combination of actions in our manuals."
"have a crooked building. In order to insert the reinforcement accordingly, I want to enter a different angle instead of the 90° between the directions. Why can't I change this in mask 1.4 of RF-CONCRETE Surfaces?","The 90° angle between the reinforcement directions can only be changed if the serviceability check is not carried out using the analytical method. If the SLS is examined non-linearly, the angle can be adjusted. "
How do I model the elastic support of a rib on a wall when in reality the beam and slab are supported on the wall? Does the rib have to be additionally supported in an elastic way?,"It should normally be sufficient to just provide the ceiling slab with line supports. The rib is already an integral part of the floor as a T-beam.If you still want to support the bar with a nodal support, you could split the line just before the rib and remove the line support from the rest of the piece. With this method, no warning would be displayed during the calculation that there is a nodal support and a line support at the same time.You will find some interesting technical articles on our website on the subject of ""joists"" (see Links below)."
Which roof and ground plan shapes can be taken into account with the wind and snow load generators in RFEM/RSTAB?,"The load generators capture a rectangular building shape. The following roof shapes are available for the roof geometry:Flat roofPent roofGable roofFor different buildings or roof shapes, you can apply the loads manually with the function ""Generate loads → From surface loads on members using planes"". The load size must be determined manually.However, the wind load can also be generated for any building geometry with the new independent program RWIND Simulation. This offers you the possibility of wind simulation and the generation of wind loads. In connection with the FEM structural analysis software RFEM or the framework program RSTAB, the possibilities can be optimally used. Input The direct transfer of models from RFEM or RSTAB makes it possible to define relevant parameters of the wind directions to be analyzed with height-dependent wind profiles based on a wind standard. This results in the corresponding load cases with additional globally stored parameters.Without RFEM or RSTAB, RWIND Simulation can be operated manually. For this purpose, the data can be imported from STL vector graphics.The transfer of terrain and buildings in the surrounding area to the simulation is also possible from STL files.Through the exchange between RFEM and RSTAB and RWIND Simulation, you can easily use the results of the wind analysis as load cases in your usual working environment of RFEM or RSTAB.Services of RWIND Simulation 3D incompressible wind flow analysis with OpenFoam solvers Direct Model transfer from RFEM or RSTAB or STL files Easy model modification via drag-and-drop and graphical adjustment aids Automatic corrections of the model topology with shrink wrap meshes Possibility to add objects from the environment (buildings, terrain, ...)

Why don't I get stresses on the top and bottom of a temperature loaded rod (heating on the top) if the rod is not bedded? Or why does an upwardly curved rod (from heating on the top) have a tensile stress on the bottom when the rod is bedded? This should then be compressive stress on the underside.,"The subject can be easily illustrated using a single-span beam. Three systems are described below for this purpose. These models are documented in the attached file.System 1Statically determinate system (no bedding), dT = 80 ° on topThe member curves upwards, but is inherently free of tension.System 2aLike system 1, but with an additional rod bedding. The member bedding is entered here without possible failure (non-linearity).If you display the stresses sigma_x of the member for system 2a, you get compression on the upper side of the member and tension on the lower side of the member . The curvature of the member and the existing member bedding cause a contact force pz, which is intended to prevent the member from bending upwards.These contact forces pz are caused by the bending of the bar due to the temperature and the applied bar bedding. The contact forces shown can be replaced by a member load that opposes the curvature. This is shown in system 2b in the example file.System 2bThe member bedding is removed and the variable member load in the Z direction is entered.When comparing the Results (e.g. the deformations uz) on the two systems 2a and 2b give equivalent results.In addition, the stresses sigma_x can also be displayed for the two systems 2a and 2b. These are also equivalent.System 3 was only introduced to document the stresses due to temperature differences in a statically determined system (without bedding).The ""single-span beam "" documented results can also be transferred to elastically bedded surfaces."
"In RF-/STEEL EC3, no effective lengths for the minor axis and lateral-torsional buckling are specified in the ""Effective Lengths - Members/Sets of Members"" window. Why is that?","If the equivalent member method has been selected for a straight set of members, lateral supports can be defined in Table 1.4. These hinder buckling around the weak axis of the set of bars. If the lateral supports result in different buckling lengths for a set of members, Table 1.6 does not show any values for Lcr,z, Lw and LT."
"When graphically displaying the deformed model, I can't find a way to display intermediate values.","If the check box in the Show navigator is activated, all intermediate values for the local member deformations are displayed. The same applies to the result curves.Depending on how many intermediate nodes are defined for the respective member, the corresponding deformation values in the division points are displayed in the result tables in addition to the node values and maximum values."
"If you display the deformations of LF1, the maximum is 10 mm. If you then look at the deformations of LK1 (defined as 1.0 * LF1), the result is a larger deformation. How can that be?","Load combinations are calculated by default according to 2nd order theory, load cases according to 1st order. It is possible that when calculating according to the 2nd order theory, the stiffness is also reduced with a standard-dependent partial safety factor, which has a corresponding effect on the deformations.To ensure the same results in the load case and in the load case combination obtained, one would have to uniformly regulate the consideration of the stiffness coefficients in this case."
"When I rotate my model in the view, the center of the model is always the center of rotation. Can I also put the rotation center in the center of the current view?","Unfortunately, this possibility does not exist directly in the program. The rotation using the ""Ctrl"" key or the mouse wheel is always related to the model center.However, in RFEM and RSTAB there is the option of rotating around any node: Select the desired node. You can then rotate the model around the selected node by simultaneously pressing the ""Alt"" key and the mouse wheel or the middle mouse button. "
How does the torsional stiffness (profile deformation) influence the torsional restraint? I can't find them anywhere in the program.,"The profile deformations can be activated or deactivated in the parameters of the members and sets of members. According to EN 1993-1-1, the profile deformation is included in the calculation as follows:$\frac{\displaystyle1}{\displaystyle{\mathrm C}_{\vartheta,\mathrm k}}= \;\frac{\displaystyle1}{\displaystyle{\mathrm C}_{\mathrm{ϑR},\mathrm k}}\;+\;\frac{\displaystyle1}{\displaystyle{\mathrm C}_{ \mathrm{ϑC},\mathrm k}}\;+\;\frac{\displaystyle1}{\displaystyle{\mathrm C}_{\mathrm{ϑD},\mathrm k}}$After the calculation, the value can be read from the result tables.You can find the calculation of the value in the relevant literature or in Manual for the additional module RF-BGDK."
 I have problems installing the Dlubal programs. What could be the reason?,"Installation problems are often caused by the following: Antivirus softwareIf the installation is aborted with an error message in which the term ""HASP"" appears (see picture), so your antivirus program is blocking the installation of the dongle driver. Please disable anti-virus software during installation so that the driver can be installed. User RightsMake sure the user has sufficient rights. The document mentioned under Downloads contains detailed information on this. It is recommended to start the installation file using the context menu (right-click) option ""Run as administrator"". Windows UpdatesMake sure your operating system is up to date and has the latest updates installed. This is often a problem with older operating systems (Windows 7/8) since the updates can be deactivated manually. With Windows 10, the updates are usually installed automatically."
Where can I get the steel stresses for a surface design with RF-CONCRETE?,"In RF-CONCRETE Surfaces, you can use the [Info] button to display the corresponding steel stress for the ultimate limit state for each design point. A graphic output is not possible here.When verifying the serviceability, it is also possible to display the steel stress graphically, since a corresponding verification can be carried out here."
Where can I find the internal forces at specific nodes in the printout report?,"The easiest way to find the internal forces at these nodes is to print graphics of the members in the printout report.In the event that this solution is not an option, you can also use the Take result table 4.1 in the printout report. Since only the extreme values are activated by default, you must also activate the node values in the selection. Most of the time it does not make sense to include the internal forces of all members in the printout report have. In the selection, therefore, only select the members that are relevant to you. "
How can I prevent the FE mesh and thus all results from being deleted when importing a model?,"When opening a model with results and FE mesh in a newer program version, the FE mesh and thus the results may be deleted. It is therefore advisable to always open models in the version last used. Updates can, for example, contain adjustments in the FE mesh generator that make it necessary to delete the mesh.In the project manager, there is the option of checking the file with regard to its properties. The version number is also stored there."
"The printout report is not printed out. All other file formats such as PDF, DOC etc. can be printed on my printer. When printing a printout report (old and new files), no message appears in the printer folder. There is also no error message. Exporting to a PDF works, but printing to PDF doesn't either.Can you help me?",Outdated or faulty printer drivers are usually the cause of printout problems.Please try the following:Exit the Dlubal software.Open the settings for your printers and scanners in Windows.Select a different printer (e.g. a PDF printer) as the default printer.Start Dlubal software and try printing again.
How do I get a radial mesh refinement with angular basic geometry?,"The mesh refinements have been adjusted over the course of the versions. They are currently being matched to the geometry: For example, if you have an angular basic geometry, the compression is applied angularly. If, on the other hand, the basic geometry is round, the densification is also aligned radially.In order to mesh a partial area radially in an angular basic geometry, you could insert a circular opening in the surface and this again with a circular surface of the original thickness close (see picture)."
"In CRANEWAY, I would like to apply the forces from the crane track that are actually acting simultaneously on the two supports.

"In SHAPE-THIN I activated the calculation of the effective cross-section in the basic data. However, the calculation cannot be carried out. Error 2305 appears. What to do?","In order to determine the effective cross-section values, at least one load case (Table 2.1 load cases) with corresponding internal forces (Table 3.1 internal forces) must be defined: The effective cross-sectional parameters are load-dependent.In addition, the so-called c/t parts (Table 1.7 c/t parts) are required. The program usually creates these automatically."
"Can I also load loads in RSTAB or RFEM, e.g. B. from a multi-layer floor structure?","In RFEM and RSTAB it is possible to generate loads from a multi-layer structure. Some floor and roof structures are already included in the multilayer structure library. This library can be edited and expanded at will. The load type ""multilayer structure"" can be used for surface loads and generated loads, among other things.So that the library does not have to be created by each employee, it is possible to transfer the file for the user-defined structures to another computer. To do this, copy the MultiLayer_User.db3 file to the appropriate directory of the multilayer structure library on the target computer. You can read the path to the respective database directories in the ""Program options""."
Is it possible to import multiple IFC files directly into an existing model? Or do I have to first open the files separately (as reference objects) and then merge them into the model?,"Yes, that is possible. You can import and represent multiple IFC files in the CAD/BIM model. The corresponding setting must be made in the ""Basic model data"".You can find more information in a technical article on the subject ""BIM workflow: Data exchange using IFC files"" on our website."
Can I model a deflection pulley with RFEM?,"In RFEM, a deflection pulley can be simulated using the ""Cable on sheaves"" member type. So can z. B. Calculate pulley systems.It is imperative to ensure that the rod, including all kinks, consists of just one polyline. Otherwise the model would hang up at the nodal bearings and no force deflection would take place at these points."
I assigned a line load to a member. The message appears that the line is loaded but does not belong to the area.,"In general, line loads are assigned to lines within the program.Line loads are basically only suitable for lines that belong to an area. This means that the line must either represent the boundary of the area or be integrated into the area. If a line is to be loaded that is assigned to both a member and a surface, this is possible without any problems.If there is no surface and a member is to be loaded with a distributed load, the load type Bar load can be used."
"How do I get the current authorization file for RFEM 5, RSTAB 8 and other individual programs?","Log in to your Dlubal account on our website.If you've previously emailed us, you shouldn't have any problems logging into your account. When logging in for the first time, you must use the ""Reset password"" function and then assign your own password.After logging in, you can find it under ""Licenses → Authorization files for download | RFEM 5, RSTAB 8, ..."" all AUTHOR.INI files that are current for your licenses (see Illus. 02)."
How can I determine the effective cross-section values according to EC 3 or EC 9 with SHAPE-THIN?,"Activate the ""c/t parts and effective cross-section properties"" option in the general data for the cross-section. You can then use the ""Calculation parameters"" button to open the dialog of the same name. In the second tab you specify the desired standard. The elements of the cross-section must then be entered. The c/t parts are usually generated automatically from the geometry constraints, but can also be created user-defined in Table 1.7 Cross-section parts for classification or the corresponding dialog. In Table 2.1 Load Cases or in the ""Edit Load Cases and Combinations"" dialog box, a load case must then be defined and in Table 3.1 or in the ""Edit X-Point"" dialog box, the internal forces must then be defined. Results of effective cross-section are accessible after calculation with button Effective widths. "
During the calculation I get a warning that the calculation of a load case does not converge. What should I do?,"With this note, check the non-linearities present in the model and the plausibility of the results. The sum of the load and the sum of the bearing forces could also help with checking. If you find significant deviations there, the results cannot be used for further analysis. It often helps to increase the number of load levels and the number of iterations in the calculation parameters. "
Is it possible to open an RSTAB file in RFEM and vice versa?,"In RFEM it is possible to open and further edit structures with loads and load cases that have already been modeled in RSTAB. This can be necessary, for example, if it is determined during model input that it makes sense to include surface elements such as wall or ceiling slabs in the existing RSTAB model.To open an RSTAB file in RFEM , the file type must either be changed to ""File type RSTAB"" or to ""All files"" in the ""Open"" dialog. This not only displays the RFEM files, but also all the RSTAB files stored in the selected directory. After opening the RSTAB file, the model can be saved as an RFEM file and processed further.It should be noted, however, that printout reports or input data that have already been created in add-on modules are not accepted.An RFEM file can be read into RSTAB by renaming the file extension *.rf5 to *.rs8. All module entries and printout logs are also deleted here. It should also be noted that only beam structures are transferred to RSTAB; Area elements are deleted."
Can I check the input of the nodal supports for a set of members in the RF-/STEEL EC3 add-on module? I'm not sure if my entries are correct.,"The easiest way to check the nodal supports defined in RF-/STEEL EC3 is to use the graphical output. You can activate this using the ""Local coordinate system"" button below the graphic in mask 1.7."
"Only the moments about the strong axis (y-axis) are taken into account in the verification of a classic, rigid end plate joint. If moments about the weak axis are entered, the resulting tensile forces are not taken into account in the design. Am I seeing this correctly?",The verifications with our module RF-/JOINTS Steel - Rigid are based on the assumptions and regulations of the EN 1993-1-8 standard. The bending from the main supporting plane is not dealt with here. This is also output as a note during the design. With RFEM it is possible to model any rigid joint. All internal forces can then be taken into account there. You can find an example file attached to this FAQ.
"Are there verification examples in which I can understand the results of RFEM, RSTAB and the add-on modules?",On our website you will find a separate area with many verification examples.
"When I look at the results of the deformation analysis in the SLS for the add-on modules in the RSTAB work window, a much larger value is output for both the local and the global deformation in the Z direction than in the add-on modules.","When checking the deformation value, e.g. B. STEEL EC3 outputs the deformation check, the node deformations must be subtracted from the total deformation shown in RSTAB: The deformation value in the middle of the member represents the total deformation of the member (deformation of the nodes plus deformation of the member).If the deformation is referred to the ""undeformed system"" in the detail settings of the add-on module for the serviceability limit state analysis, then the maximum deformation including the node deformations (deformation value displayed in RSTAB/RFEM) is used."
Is it possible to create a custom line moment similar to forces?,"Yes, this type of load exists. You can e.g. B. can be defined as a parabolic torque curve."
"For the sake of clarity, it would be desirable if the area loads were hatched in a plan view (e.g. ceiling plan). Is this possible?",You can set the display of area loads with hatching in the Display navigator.RFEM creates different hatching depending on the load size.
Where can I find information about changes in the program during an update?,"You can find information on changes, new features and adjustments in the updates on our homepage in the Update reports."
Is it possible to parameterize models and loads with RSTAB and RFEM?,"If projects or individual assemblies of a model are similar, it makes sense to parameterize the model or assemblies. Formulas can also be used for the individual ""parameters"". If a parameter is changed in the respective formula, the model is adjusted in the background.Various variables are available for the parameters, such as e.g. B. Cross-sections, loads, angles, lengths, surface thickness. In the Downloads Below is an example file with the parameterized model of a simple construction."
"The crane runway has small cantilever beams at the beginning and end so that the wheels can reach the support. In these areas, the deformations show impermissible values. What should I do?","According to current recommendations, the deformation analysis for a cantilever-shaped crane runway girder is performed using the following formulas: The program cannot distinguish whether the verification for the examined crane runway girder is meaningless or not. This decision must be made by the engineer.Most of the time, a simple note in the statics is sufficient for the inspector. Alternatively, one could consider whether such a girder is relevant for the design of the entire crane runway girder and possibly ignore it when entering the geometry.In a webinar on the topic ""Design of crane runway girders according to Eurocode 3"" you will find further information on the verifications with CRANEWAY. You can get it at the Links below."
I designed a steel connection with RF-/JOINTS and remodeled it in RFEM for comparison. Why aren't the results identical?,"In RF-/JOINTS, an idealized design of a steel connection according to the standard takes place, which cannot easily be compared with an exact FE calculation. The results of numerical and analytical verification methods differ in particular due to the simplifications and assumptions made.For example, the following points must be considered when calculating a connection as a surface model:Consideration or exclusion of friction/compression/tension within the contact volume (""Contact"" tab) as well as in the modeled boltsConsideration of internal forces and deformations within modeled end plates or similar, which means that in the FE calculation a Redistribution of the bolt forces takes place (in contrast to the idealized verification in RF-/JOINTS) Uniform load introduction into the FE model, e.g. B. using rigid members/rigid surfaces as in the technical article FEM modeling approach rigid connections described You will find a number of webinars and specialist articles on this topic on our website (see links below)."
"have two import files (solid construction: ifc file, steel construction: dxf file). Can I merge both files in RFEM and edit them as an overall model?","You can create a new model and import the ifc file (or the dxf file) there. Then import the other import file into the existing model as a background layer.Alternatively, you can create two separate models and merge them using the block manager (see FAQ at the Links below)."
I am not able to import a cross-section from SHAPE-THIN into RSTAB.

I would like to import a cross-section as a DXF into SHAPE-THIN and automatically convert it into a cross-section. Where can I find this function?,"You can import the DXF file via the ""File → Import"" menu. However, it is usually necessary to rework the file.Elements can be set later on the basis of the DXF template. This function can be called up via the ""Edit → Set elements with DXF template"" menu. The ""Set elements according to DXF template"" dialog appears.First, create the center lines by clicking on the opposing DXF outlines. With the ""Set elements"" option, the elements can then be set by clicking on the center lines. In the case of non-parallel outlines, the elements must be set manually, as SHAPE-THIN can only create elements and arcs from parallel lines.In the recording of a Info day as a video the DXF import is presented from minute 45:50.

How can you quickly generate moving loads with RFEM/RSTAB?,Define multiple load cases to capture the moving load. Each load case should correspond to a specific position of the moving load in the system.The load cases from the load positions on members can easily be calculated using the modules RF-MOVE (for RFEM) and RSMOVE (for RSTAB) With RF-MOVE surfaces load cases from moving loads on surfaces can also be generated in RFEM.
"When creating the FE mesh, the message appears that distorted elements have been detected. What should I do?","The display of the FE mesh quality represents an aid for the calculation of flat components. When the mesh is generated, the generated FE elements are checked internally according to specific criteria. The result can be displayed graphically. The three levels of quality are shown in green, yellow or red.The values of the checked criteria can be customized. They can thus be adapted to the individual requirements.The control of the FE mesh quality enables an assessment of the discretization. For example, areas that require FE mesh refinement can be localized. However, it cannot replace the engineer's control of the FE mesh by the user."
"When importing a .stp file into RFEM, I get an error message telling me to choose a different format. How to import .stp files?","Unfortunately, there are two different interfaces with the same file extension - the .stp interface of the DGerman STahlbau-Vassociation ( DSTV), on the other hand the STEP interface (STandard for the Exchange of Pproduct model data), which is defined in the ISO standard 10303 is defined.While the DSTV interface refers to the system axes of members, i.e. to the static model, the STEP interface refers to the model geometry in the form of boundary lines, surfaces and simple volumes. With the latter, the models can be imported either as RFEM objects (nodes, lines, surfaces, volumes) or as a background layer for manual picking of the points. As a rule, the STEP interface does not transfer any system lines, but only the outer contours of the components, so that the system levels have to be created manually afterwards. This can be done in RFEM and RSTAB, for example, with the CAD/BIM model.If you get the error message shown in Illus. 01, you have tried to import an .stp file based on STEP via the DSTV interface. As described above, the two formats are not compatible with each other.In this case, select the STEP format for the import. If the message appears, it is because this interface requires the additional module RF-LINK."
"When checking before the calculation, the message appears: ""Error No. 16 when generating the FE mesh. Two or more nodes have the same coordinates.""","In this case, you can try to fine-tune the FE mesh.However, it is usually better to regenerate the model and change the node coordinates, e.g. B. to round to 6 digits. You can call up this function via the ""Extras → Regenerate model"" menu. This eliminates the inaccuracies caused by the smallest differences in a coordinate.Duplicate nodes can also be found using the model check (menu ""Extras → Model check → Identical nodes""). In the following dialog you can specify what should happen to these nodes."
Can I display the center of gravity of my model?,"Select the whole model (or just a group of objects) and click the selection with the right mouse button. Then select the ""Center of gravity and info"" function in the context menu.The result is an overview of the center of gravity coordinates as well as additional information such as material volume and mass.

How can I import or convert SketchUp models in RFEM or RSTAB?,"The 3skeng Steelwork program in SketchUp allows exporting IFC files based on the ""Structural Analysis View"". This view contains the static system including member end hinges as well as the cross-section and material properties.The IFC file can be imported via ""File → Import"". You can find a detailed description on the website of SHK Engineering and Consulting GmbH & Co. KG."
"How can I represent the generated load as member loads without ""exploding"" the load?","A generated load can be displayed not only as a surface load, but also in the form of member loads: Right-click on the generated load and select the ""Show separately"" function from the context menu. In the webinar on the topic ""Design of steel structures according to EC 3 | Part 1: Modeling, load input, combinatorics"" the load generation is discussed, among other things."
"Error 727 ""Line support of type 'Wall in Z' on line no. ... is not connected to any horizontal surface"" appears during the plausibility check. What should I do?","The ""Wall"" line support type is actually intended for ceiling slabs that are e.g. B. rest elastically embedded on a masonry wall. This tool is therefore only permitted for horizontal surfaces. The spring stiffness of the wall is calculated and applied in the calculation.If the surfaces are not in a horizontal position, the spring must be entered manually.To calculate the spring stiffness of a wall as To use this as a starting point for your own entries, you can first define the wall and then uncheck ""Wall"": The determined spring parameters remain in the input fields and can be edited."
"Warning 282449 ""Line no.... are identical"" appears. Do identical lines affect the calculation? Do I need to delete identical lines?","Surfaces may not be connected when they should be. In this respect, double lines can definitely have an impact on the calculation. It is better to clean the model and remove all double lines.You can quickly find double lines with the ""Extras → Model Control → Overlapping Lines"" function. In this tool, the line pairs can also be output as an Excel list, or excerpts can be generated (see marked buttons in Illus. 02).However, it is often the case that the lines cannot simply be deleted , since they are assigned to different objects. If you delete one of the lines, e.g. B. also deleted a surface. You should therefore first check for all components whether the lines can be deleted and if necessary change the boundary lines. In the attached video you can see how the boundary lines of the areas can be quickly exchanged. The remaining double line can then be easily deleted."
"How do the load types ""initial prestress"" and ""final prestress"" differ?","Initial prestressThe initial prestress can be imagined as a temperature load: the rod is cooled and it tries to shorten. When the rod is held by the ends, a tensile force occurs in the rod. If the bar is held rigid at the ends, then the tensile force corresponds exactly to the prestressing force. If it is elastic, then the tensile force in the member is correspondingly smaller.Final prestress (RFEM only) In the final prestress, an iterative calculation method is used to ensure that the member retains the entered prestress force - regardless of the stiffness of the adjacent structure. However, the disadvantage here is that the calculation takes longer and that the model can become unstable."
How can I depict a hole bearing in the model?,"With a bearing bearing, the forces are only transmitted via pressure. Tensile forces do not occur. You could model these effects as follows:1. Create opening in surface 2. Create a beam with Failure in tension nonlinearity and place it in the opening. It is important to use a beam strut and not a compression strut (a compression strut is a truss, making the system kinematic).3. Rotate the rod in the opening and copy it several times.Instead of the rods, you could also fill the opening with an area with the stiffness Diaphragm Free. When using this surface stiffness, the following happens:The calculation is done in multiple iterations. After the first iteration, it is checked in which surface elements tension occurs for the main membrane stress. These elements fail in the next iteration (or rather, the stiffness is greatly reduced).You should get roughly the same results with both modeling variants."
How can I model two overlapping surfaces?,"The easiest way is to create a solid contact between the two surfaces. With the help of the contact volume, the contact properties of the surfaces lying on top of each other can be described precisely. In the FAQ on the topic ""How can I quickly add a contact volume between create two contact surfaces?"" you will find information on how to create a contact solid.If the contact conditions play a subordinate role and both surfaces have the same material properties, you could also change the thickness of a surface at the appropriate point simply enlarge and use only one area."
Is it possible to model a disk made of trapezoidal sheets? ,"There are two possibilities:1. Modeling as a folded structure 2. Modeling as an orthotropic surface The first option only makes sense if the stresses in the trapezoidal sheet are of interest. Each individual bead is to be mapped with surfaces. The effort for modeling and calculation is very high. The modeling can be made a little easier: All common trapezoidal profiles are contained in the profile library of RFEM. Place a bar with the cross section of a trapezoidal profile. Then use the context menu function to split the member into surfaces. You can then modify or copy the resulting surfaces with trapezoidal sheets. If only the stiffness of the trapezoidal sheet is relevant for the analysis, modeling as an orthotropic surface makes sense . When defining the surface, select the ""Orthotropic"" stiffness type. The [Parameter] button next to the list allows you to define the orthotropy properties. The stiffness can be described using equivalent thicknesses or directly using the coefficients of the stiffness matrix (see manual). Any angle related to the local surface axis system can be specified for the orthotropy direction. This angle can also be checked graphically (Show Navigator: ""Model → Surfaces → Orthotropy Directions""). "
How can I change the axis system of a line or bar?,"Right click on the line or rod. Then select the ""Reverse line orientation"" or ""Reverse member orientation"" function in the context menu.A rotation of the line or member axis system is possible via a rotation angle that you define in the ""Edit line"" or ""Edit member"" dialog. Alternatively, the rod can also be aligned with an auxiliary node."
"I shared a line in a surface model. The designation ""Releases → Line release → Forces → n"" is in the results navigator. What does ""n"" mean?","This is the normal force of the surface, which is denoted by a small n.This specification is useful, for example, if a spring in x has been defined. The force of the spring that is transferred can then be read off via n."
"To create the FE mesh, I used the ""Layered Mesh"" function to create a homogeneous mesh with the same aspect ratios. Even though the opposite faces are the same, I don't get a layered mesh.","A layered volume mesh with an even split can only be created for volumes whose opposing faces are defined exactly the same. It is also important to ensure that the lines contained in the surfaces match: they must not be in the form of different divisions or defined twice.Please check the geometry of your model. The ""Extras → Model Control → Overlapping Lines"" function is also helpful for this."
I would like to reduce the allowable stress in STEEL by a few percent. Is this possible?,"There are several ways to apply reduced allowable stresses. In the STEEL and RF-STEEL Members modules you can activate the Manual option in the ""1.2 Materials"" window in column D and then change the limit stresses in the following columns. Alternatively, create a user-defined material in the material library for which you can individually define the material properties (yield point, strength)."
How can I quickly create a contact solid between two contact surfaces in RFEM?,The quickest way to create a solid in contact between two planar surfaces is to use the Create Solid in Contact tool. Select the two contact surfaces and select the corresponding function in the context menu.The program then automatically creates a contact solid including all boundary surfaces and openings in the solid. You only need to define the contact properties in the settings of the contact volume.
I can no longer open RFEM and RSTAB: Nothing happens after double-clicking the icon! No error message is displayed either. Restarting the computer didn't solve the problem either.,"The problem is probably due to the antivirus software that is preventing the program from starting. View the activity log of the antivirus software and define appropriate exceptions if necessary. It is also advisable to exclude the following files and folders from real-time monitoring: Program folders from RFEM or RSTAB: C:\Program Files\Dlubal\RFEM 5.xx C:\Program Files\Dlubal\RSTAB 8.xx C:\Program Files\Dlubal\RFEM 6.xx C:\Program Files\Dlubal\RSTAB 9.xx Application files: C:\Program Files\Common Files\Dlubal C :\Program Files\Common Files\Dlubal SoftwareData folder of RFEM and RSTAB: C:\ProgramData\Dlubal Temporary data folder: C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Temp\Dlubal (= default setting) C:\Users \Username\AppData\Local\DlubalLicense Service: C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Aladdin Shared\HASP\hasplms.exe This measure often improves performance and prevents problems with the calculation.

"In RF-CONCRETE Surfaces, I cannot make any settings for the deformation analysis because the tab is missing.

"In RFEM, the Poisson's ratios of glued laminated timber for isotropic linear-elastic calculation are wrong: Values from 7 to 9 are stored there.","This Poisson's ratio is irrelevant for member calculations, as it is only used for surfaces and solids.In an isotropic material model, the Poisson's ratio is firmly linked to the Young's modulus and the shear modulus. If the Poisson's ratio becomes too large and exceeds the limits, the material behavior is no longer isotropic. To work around the problem, an orthotropic material should be created for surfaces and solids. An isotropic material model must still be selected for members. In this case, the message can be ignored."
"How is the skew force ""S"" to be entered in CRANEWAY so that it acts against the HS force?","The S force and the HS forces must always be entered with the correct sign.

"After an import, not all cross-sections are recognized in RFEM/RSTAB. How can I solve the problem?","This problem occurs when the imported cross-section designation does not exist in RFEM/RSTAB. For such cases there is the possibility of creating a kind of 'translation table' in the form of a conversion file. You can call this up in the ""Detailed Settings"" tab of the ""Import"" dialog.During an import, the program then converts all entered cross-sections so that they can be recognized by RFEM/RSTAB.There is also a conversion table with the same structure for materials."

What should be considered when determining weld seam stresses at surface joints?,"In order to read the weld seam stresses, it is important to know which of the surface stress types shown in RFEM are relevant. A simple example is shown in the picture: The tab attached in the z-direction is loaded at the upper end in the x-direction with a distributed load of 100 kN/m and in the y-direction with a distributed load of 10 kN/m. In order to determine the correct stresses, one must know the local coordinate system of the surface. It can be activated in the Show navigator under ""Model → Surfaces → Surface axis systems x, y, z"". All voltages with a ""+"" in the suffix represent the voltage at the top, ie the side of the positive local z-axis. When displaying the moments of area, it should be noted that there is a fundamental difference in understanding the sizes of areas and member sections: While a member moment My ""rotates"" about the local member axis y, a moment of area m acts >y in the direction of the local surface axis y, i.e. around the x axis of this surface.In this specific case, this means: my represents the bending moment of the bracket in the direction of the global y-axis. It must therefore have a value of 2 kNm/m as a result. The average in the diagram shown confirms this with a value of 1.95 kNm/m (deviations can be reduced using a finer FE mesh). The average of the shear flow is 100 kN/m and thus corresponds to the applied load.Thus, the stress σy,+ reflects the compressive stress of the tab at the top of the surface; τxy,x corresponds to the shear stress in the joint on the same side.The stresses should only be evaluated if the weld thickness is equal to the surface thickness. Otherwise the stresses should be determined manually from the internal forces."
"When I want to rotate my model using middle mouse button and ctrl, the rotation point is not the center of gravity but a point far away. How to fix?","There is probably another node somewhere in the room - sometimes right at the origin of the coordinates, which is why it is not found.First, deactivate the visibility mode if necessary. Then use the ""Show model as a whole"" function. In most cases, the responsible object can then be found quickly."
"By default, in CRANEWAY, the crane travels beyond the ends of the girder. How can I prevent this?","In order to determine the maximum support forces, it is often necessary for the crane to be able to travel beyond the beam to be verified. This ensures that e.g. e.g. with an asymmetrical load distribution, each wheel actually runs over the critical point of the girder.However, if there are girder buffers that prevent the crane from moving out at the left and/or right end, the Distances bL and bR can be specified. This also reduces the number of load combinations generated.An eccentric arrangement of the buffers can be described in a dialog using the [Details] button.More information for the dimensioning of crane runway girders can be found in a webinar that You can access them at the links below."
How can I verify an existing construction made of B 25 with the appropriate reinforcement using BETON?,"To carry out the design with CONCRETE or RF-CONCRETE Members according to an 'old' standard, click the filter for ""Only show valid standards / national annexes"" in window 1.1. After that, standards that are no longer valid can also be applied to the design of the existing property."
"In my model, there are members that receive member end moments despite moment hinges at the hinges. How can that be?","Please check the twists in the knots: sometimes bars are not properly connected to the knots (minimal inaccuracies) and two knots are very close to each other (see picture). This results in unrealistically large rotations around the member axis, which lead to these moments."
"did not find a way to accept line moments in the ""Accept support reactions as loads"" function. How can I import the mx moments from a line support as a load?","Load transfer with the mentioned function is limited to vertical loads (transfer in 2D systems). If support reactions are required in other directions, they must be transferred manually.To make manual transfer easier, you could display the ""smooth distribution"" per line instead of the ""actual"" support reactions. The following applies, of course: the finer the subdivision of the lines, the more precisely (more gradations) the result approximates the actual course."
How can I design the top and bottom layers of a bar with a rectangular cross-section separately?,"In RF-CONCRETE Members or CONCRETE you will find this setting in the ""1.6 Reinforcement"" window, ""Reinforcement arrangement"" tab: You can select the desired option under ""Reinforcement distribution""."
How do I combine several partial models into an overall model?,"If only the geometry is relevant, you can select the desired elements, copy them with Ctrl+C and then paste them into the other file with Ctrl+V.It is a good idea to also record the loads the block manager: Save each model as a block. You can then import the blocks together with the loads into an existing model using the block manager.Select the entire model (or just individual components) and save it as a block. If you then insert the block into another model, the load cases of the block are attached to the load cases of the model. An automatic integration of the load cases into existing load cases is not yet possible. The adjustment must therefore be made manually. The easiest way to do this is with the ""Add load cases"" function."
Can 'Solids' be modeled and statically calculated in RFEM?,"Of course, volume elements can be created with RFEM. These are mainly at z. B. particularly shaped machine components or very thick objects useful or if a representation as a surface element is no longer possible. The calculation of solids provides deformations, stresses and strains.Another area of application for solids is the mapping of contact properties. With a contact volume z. For example, the transmission conditions of connections with the properties ""Failure in compression"" or ""Failure in tension"" can be modeled for the contact perpendicular to the contact surfaces. Parallel to the surfaces are the properties ""Failure if contact with the surfaces does not work"", ""Full power transmission"", ""Rigid friction"", ""Rigid friction with limitation"", ""Elastic friction"", Elastic friction with limitation"" and ""Behaviour of the Elastic Solids"" to choose from.Contact properties between two contact surfaces can also be realized using surface releases. They are described in the RFEM manual:RFEM online manual | 4.27 Surface release typesOnline RFEM manual | 4.28 Surface approvalsThe modeling with solid elements is also presented in a video from a Dlubal info day, which you can access at the Links below ."
I would like to calculate a multi-span beam. Is it possible to apply the live loads automatically by span (for the design of the largest support and span moment)?,"For a panel-by-panel (chessboard-like) arrangement of the loads, a separate load case must be created manually for each panel that is to be loaded. With the automatic combination of the actions that can be specified in the ""General data"" of the model, all possible load positions are then taken into account."
The additional module shows that there is a different cross-section than in the main program. How should I proceed?,"If a different cross-section is used in the add-on module than in RFEM/RSTAB, it is displayed in blue font. This should also indicate that the internal forces are determined with the cross-section defined in RSTAB/RFEM (IPE 300), but the design in the add-on module is carried out with the cross-section assigned there (IPE 80) . Different cross-sections exist if the cross-section was changed manually in the add-on module or optimized by the program.You can either import the cross-section from RFEM/RSTAB again (menu ""Edit → Import cross-section from RFEM/RSTAB"") or transfer the cross-section of the add-on module to the main program (menu ""Edit → Transfer cross-section to RFEM/RSTAB""). The cross sections are then identical again and are displayed in black type."
What is the best way to determine tension bars at wall ends (bracing loads)?,"You could measure the wall ends (at the transition to the ceilings) with RF-CONCRETE surfaces. The result is the required amount of reinforcement in [cm²/m].Alternatively, you could insert results bars into the areas with the decisive tensile force in the walls and thus integrate the resulting surface internal forces into bar section sizes in these areas. One should pay attention to a sufficient FE mesh refinement in the integration area. This procedure is also described in a article in our Knowledge -Base, which you can access below in the Links.You can then design the resulting members with the member section sizes, which actually come from the surfaces, in RF-CONCRETE Members ( in this case for a pulling force). This gives you the tensile reinforcement required for a defined area in [cm²].The evaluation of the results roughly corresponds to the theory of wall-type beams. In the technical article on ""Design of wall-like beams in RFEM"" this is described in more detail."
"Can I subsequently assign a new number to nodes, members, sets of members, load cases, etc.?","You can call up this function in the ""Extras → Renumber → Individual"" menu. In the dialog, set the object that you want to renumber, e.g. B. ""Sets of members"". Then enter the new start number, e.g. ""100"". Make sure that this number has not yet been assigned.You can then click on the elements in the graphic one after the other to change the numbers."
How do I model and design a hole or large opening in a reinforced concrete beam?,"A surface model with result members is usually suitable for modeling. With a result member, the internal forces of a surface can be integrated and output as member section sizes. Another advantage is that result bars with the specification of a cross-section can also be designed in the RF-CONCRETE Members module.In the upper model of the sample file, the result bar was drawn over the entire length of the beam. In the lower model, on the other hand, the result bars were assigned precisely to each individual surface. Accordingly, the result curves  are obtained.After the design in RF-CONCRETE Members. For the upper model, the correct distribution of the reinforcement in the area of the breakthrough would still have to be adjusted manually. In the model below, however, the reinforcement is distributed exactly according to the cross-sectional dimensions of the result bars.You can also find a Technical article in our Knowledge Base, which you can access below at the Links."
Is it possible to display the resultant for the results of a line release or line hinge?,"For example, when dimensioning and selecting the means of connection between two surfaces, it is useful to know the resultant forces or moments between the surfaces.The resultants for the results of line hinges and line releases can be set using the Results navigator under the ""Releases"" entry. A route-related evaluation or the consideration of the total value is possible."
How can I display the internal forces of a connecting rod or rigid member?,"The representation of internal forces for couplings (tie bars, rigid bars) is deactivated by default. However, you can quickly activate the display of internal forces and deformations for these member types in the Show navigator."
Why is the beta factor given as 1.0 in the punching analysis of a wall corner?,"The load increase factor β = 1.0 is due to the fact that the ""non-smoothed course of the shear forces"" is used in window 1.5. This is the standard setting for wall corners and wall ends.If you change the setting to ""Smoothed distribution of shear forces in the critical perimeter"", the load increase factor β comes into play. This is determined by default using the fully plastic shear stress distribution according to EN 1992-1-1, 6.4.3 (3).You can find more information on the topics ""Punching load at wall ends and wall corners"" and ""Determination of the load increase factor β"". You can refer to specialist articles in our knowledge base, which you can access using the links given below. "
"Does the required reinforcement in the Results navigator correspond to the ultimate limit state check or the serviceability check, or both?","This depends on the settings selected in the navigator: When designing for the ultimate limit states and serviceability limit states, the ""limit state"" whose required reinforcement is to be displayed can be selected in the results navigator.Es the following settings are possible:GZTGZGGZT / GZG decisive (the envelope from ""GZT/GZG"")"
How can I define fixed bar spacing of 15 cm and 30 cm in BETON?,"You can find this setting option in the ""Bar"" tab of mask 1.6: Under the Defined bar spacing option, you can specify user-defined spacing, e.g. 150mm and 300mm. Proceed as follows:Click on the [Defined bar spacing] button. In the ""Defined Stirrup distances"" on the [New] button. Enter the required distances (in the example 0.150 and 0.300) in the ""New list of possible distances between tension strut and stirrup"" dialog. Then assign a name to the list, e.g. ""Only 150 and 300 mm"". After OK, your list of stirrup spacings is available for the design. When designing the stirrup reinforcement, BETON only uses the permitted distances."
How can I model and design a slab crack in RFEM?,"Basically, the question arises as to whether the consideration of a slab crack in the static model is relevant or not.If the slab crack is to be taken into account when determining the internal forces, it can be modeled as a surface model (folded structure) (see picture 01). Two horizontal surfaces (ceilings) and one vertical surface (height offset) are created. The surfaces can then be designed with RF-CONCRETE Surfaces.Optionally, the surface internal forces that occur in the slab crack can also be integrated as member section sizes. The member type ""Result member"" is recommended for this. The internal forces of the result beam can then be used for the design in RF-CONCRETE Members.More information on the use of result beams in the floor design can be found in two technical articles in our knowledge base, which you can find below at the Links."
How can I show the result values for alpha-m (trajectories) more clearly?,You can make the adjustments in the second tab of the panel: set a suitable display factor for displaying the trajectories αm.
"How can I use thermal decoupling, e.g. by using a Schöck Isokorb^® in RFEM?","With a Schöck Isokorb^®, the tensile forces are conducted through the insulating layer by means of stainless steel and the compressive forces by means of micro steel fiber reinforced high-performance fine concrete with PE-HD plastic coating. Depending on the type selected, moments and/or lateral forces can be transferred. This limited power transmission must be taken into account in the static calculation.The technical information according to EC 2 for the Isokorb^® includes an FEM guideline in which the modeling is described.Basically, the modeling in RFEM can be done with line hinges or line releases between the respective surface elements. A distinction must be made here:Line joint The line joint should be on the outside (balcony). However, non-linearities cannot be taken into account with a line joint.Line release It is possible to enter non-linearities. This allows the spring failure of the Isokorb^® to be taken into account.The detailed procedure for entering a Schöck Isokorb^® including model files is in described in a article in our Knowledge Base that you can be accessed using the links below. You will also find a webinar in which the modeling of a balcony slab using Isokorb^® is discussed."
How does RF-PUNCH Pro calculate the VEd values of the punching load?,"RF-PUNCH Pro does not determine the punching load by adding the bearing loads, but directly from the shear forces of the slab in the critical perimeter.When comparing with a control calculation, different results are possible because the punching load from the FE mesh and possibly also by singularity effects in the FE calculation.You can find a detailed description of the method used in RF-PUNCH Pro in a technical article in our Knowledge Base, which you can find below under links."

"In window 1.1 of the RF-CONCRETE Members module, I cannot select any members for the design. However, there are reinforced concrete members in the model. Why is that?","The members in the RF-CONCRETE Members (RFEM) and CONCRETE (RSTAB) modules are not selected in table 1.1 ""General data"", but in table 1.6 ""Reinforcement"". A so-called ""reinforcement set"" is preset there by default, to which all bars are assigned.If you uncheck ""All"", you can enter the relevant bar numbers manually or define them graphically."
"Unfortunately, I can't find any information on how to design a strip foundation in RFEM. Is there no possibility? What would be an alternative?","Currently there is no add-on module for the design of strip foundations for RFEM. RF-FOUNDATION Pro only handles isolated foundations that are arranged at nodal supports.In most cases, line supports are used in the model, for which strip foundations are then to be designed. As a solution, one could create an equivalent model and apply the decisive bearing forces resulting for a ""1m strip"" as a load on a short bar (e.g. rigid bar, since there is no additional self-weight). This results in support forces at a nodal support for this 1m strip of the wall.For these nodal support forces, an individual foundation design according to EN 1997-1 could then be carried out in RF-FOUNDATION Pro by entering the "" Strip foundation"" is defined as a 1m wide slab foundation.Another alternative would be to replace the line support with a reinforced concrete slab with an elastic bedding. Then you could design the slab that represents the strip foundation in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces. The verification of the positional safety, the base compressive stresses, etc. would then have to be carried out manually with the RFEM results (e.g. evaluation of the contact stresses σz).In a technical article from our Knowledge Base you will find further information on the verification of individual foundations with RF-FOUNDATION Pro (see Links)."
The color scale in the printout report is very small and hardly legible. How can I enlarge them?,"You can increase the color scale and the font size in the printout panel as follows: When printing, set the Absolute panel size in the ""Color scale"" tab and increase the Text factor if necessary. You can also adjust this setting later in the printout report in the ""Properties"" of the graphic.If the font is enlarged, the height of the color scale usually also has to be adjusted: otherwise the font would overlap with the color scale."
"When entering the cross-section, error 32 appears: ""The cross-section type is not supported by BETON, so no design follows for this cross-section.""","When you create a new cross-section in RFEM/RSTAB, you can choose from various cross-section types in the ""Parametric - Massive"" category. If the mouse cursor lingers over a button there for a moment, information appears in which add-on modules this cross-section can be designed.The cross-sections can be selected with CONCRETE (RSTAB) and RF-CONCRETE Members (RFEM) can be designed. A ""Pi cross-section, type A"", on the other hand, is not suitable for the design with CONCRETE or RF-CONCRETE Members. However, as can be seen in the information, the cross-section can be examined with RF-TENDON. You can select this cross-section for a member in RFEM and design it in the add-on module RF-TENDON Design.Why can't all cross-sections be designed in CONCRETE or RF-CONCRETE Members? This is due to the available reinforcement layers for the individual cross-section types: If you e.g. For example, if you create and dimension a rectangular cross-section, you will find the corresponding reinforcement layers in the CONCRETE mask 1.6, ie the possible reinforcement distribution. Various reinforcement arrangements are possible for a rectangular cross-section. These reinforcement layers are required to determine the stresses and strains in the cross-section and thus the required reinforcement.This information is not available in the current development status for other cross-sections such as Pi cross-sections. Therefore, they cannot be designed with CONCRETE or RF-CONCRETE Members. If the DICKQ program is licensed, you could create the structural system with a pi cross-section in RFEM/RSTAB and determine the governing internal forces. In DICKQ it would then be possible to define the cross-section, import the internal forces from RFEM/RSTAB and design the cross-section with manual specification of the longitudinal reinforcement.More information on DICKQ can be found via the following link: https://www.dlubal.com/en/products/cross-section-values-program/dickq Solid cross-sections can be freely defined with DICKQ."
"In RF-CONCRETE Surfaces I get undesignability in some places. Notice 5 is displayed: ""Admissible concrete compressive stress in the direction of the concrete strut exceeded.""","RF-CONCRETE Surfaces displays an undesignability for some locations in table 2.1 because the concrete compressive stress is too large there. In this mask, the [Info] button can also be used to check the design details for the result row that is selected in the table above. In a new window, the values show that the absorbable membrane force is smaller than the design membrane force in the direction of the struts.The program issues a corresponding undesignability message for all finite elements with excessive concrete compressive stresses. You can find the theoretical background to this design in the RF-CONCRETE Surfaces manual. You can download it via the literature link below or call it up with the [F1] key when the module is open.To counteract the immeasurability, you can proceed as followsThe unmeasurability can be caused by singularities. As soon as it is not a pure plate, the internal size optimization can be the cause. This should be deactivated for shells and slabs.A third reinforcement direction can possibly be added.The concrete quality can be increasedThe surface thickness can be increased"
How do I determine the snow load by postcode (zip code)?,"The basis for calculating the snow load is the snow load zone in which the structure is located. The best way to determine the snow load zone and the characteristic value of the snow load sk is to use the online service Geo load determination. You can find this on the Dlubal website:Snow load zones, wind zones and earthquake zonesIn addition to the snow load zone, the wind zone and the earthquake zone for the desired location can also be determined here. In addition to the load charts for Germany, there are numerous other countries and standards to choose from in the Dlubal web application."
"With the EK, the two values of the support reactions are displayed one above the other. How can I set the spacing?","In the second tab of the panel, increase the display factor of the ""support forces"". This should improve the display.Alternatively, you can adjust the display properties via the ""Options → Display properties → Edit"" menu: Change the size in the ""Results → Support reactions → Nodal forces"" category the representation. If necessary, you can also adjust the ""Relative limit settings"" in the detailed settings.If you only want the ""Max"" or ""Min"" value to be displayed for the EK results , you can make the appropriate setting in the results navigator (see Illus. 03)."
What joint conditions should I choose for a line joint or release to compliantly couple surfaces?,"The differences can be explained using an example that compares the results of a non-linear calculation with those of a linear calculation. You can find the model file under Downloads below.The left and middle models have linear line joints. The model on the left defines a compliance in ux and uy, the model in the middle only in the direction of ux. In the model on the right, a resilience is defined in ux and uy, but a pressure contact between the surfaces is also specified. These surfaces cannot therefore penetrate each other under pressure.Checking the results shows that the model on the left is too soft: the surfaces penetrate each other due to the flexibility in uy . The middle and right models, on the other hand, deliver identical results.It often makes sense to stick with a linear calculation as far as possible. Therefore, the middle model is the most favorable for numerical investigations, even if the right (nonlinear) model represents reality even better. However, the example is only a small comparison model. In reality, you would probably not put the spring in uy/uz in this way, but assign the force to a tie rod. This is one of the reasons why the middle model without uy is recommended.The consideration of the resilience between surfaces is also discussed in a technical article in our Knowledge Base, which you can find below under the links call up."
Why can I no longer move nodes or members with the mouse in RFEM/RSTAB?,"The Drag & Enable drop disabled in the ""View"" menu. This can be used to prevent accidentally changing objects when moving the model view. Turn this feature back on."
The program crashed. Is there a way to open the backup file manually?,"The automatic backup copies are saved in the working directory in a folder named after the edited model. There are all files that are created during input and calculation, including the backup file Position.bak.Copy the Position.bak file to another one folder and then rename it to ""Model.rf5"" or ""Model.rs8"". This is how you can open the file with RFEM or RSTAB.The Position.bak file is automatically deleted when you exit the program correctly. However, after a crash, when opening RFEM/RSTAB, a message appears asking whether the backup file should be opened again."
Are my models automatically saved as I work? Where can I set the backup interval?,"The program performs an automatic data backup. You can specify the interval for saving the Position.bak file in the ""Settings → Program options"" menu on the ""Program"" tab. The default is two minutes.The automatically created backups are saved in the working directory and restored in the event of a crash when the program is restarted. If the program ends correctly, this backup copy will be deleted again."
Is there a way to effectively limit or reduce the number of load combinations to be generated?,"The problem with the generated load combinations lies in the variety of mathematical possibilities. The most important mechanisms for an effective reduction include:Minimize the number of load casesRestrict actions using alternative or grouped exclusion criteria (e.g. wind in y does not work with wind in x or wind in +x not with wind in -x)Assign imperfections to load cases (e.g. imperfection +x never with wind -x or imperfection +x never with wind +y )In this way, the generated load combinations can usually be significantly reduced.Another important decision concerns the use of load or result combinations. In a purely linear system, combinations of results can be used. Only the load cases contained in the result combination are calculated. All combinations can then be carried out with the results of these load cases.The last option is to use the integrated automated reduction of load cases. The relatively extensive functions are described in articles that you can access below at the Links."
How can I display the texts on background slides?,"Unfortunately, text is not supported in the DXF interface (direct import and background layer).As a workaround, you could use the ""ExpressTool"" available in AutoCAD and convert text to lines with the TXTEXP command. It may be necessary to install the tool afterwards."
The latest RSTAB version was recently installed on my computer. Why is there since a warning when calculating hybrid wood composite cross-sections?,"The determination of the cross-section characteristics and the dimensioning are carried out with the so-called ""γ-method"". This only takes into account the resilience of the fasteners and not the shear deformation of the sectional bars. It therefore only applies to components in which the shear deformations of the individual bars are negligibly small. If you click on OK, the shear deformations are not taken into account and a calculation is possible."
"How do you split an area along a line? Although there is a ""divide area using an integrated line"" function, I can't specify which line to divide along.","Unfortunately, the function ""Split area along a selected line"" does not exist. You can either divide the area equally or along all integrated lines.In order to divide the area on only one integrated line, the integrated lines should be temporarily managed manually. After dividing, the automatic object recognition can be switched on again."
Where can I find videos or introductory examples for the RF-COM and RS-COM modules? ,"You can find a webinar on the RF-/RS-COM module under the following link:https://www.dlubal.com/de/support-und-schulungen/schulungen/webinare/001913However, there are some examples and technical articles that you make it easier to get started:The Links below contain references to VBA examples in our Knowledge Base.On your computer you will find the Folder SDK some Excel files with examples.

"In SHAPE-THIN I want to create a cross-section from several elements. However, I do not succeed in connecting the elements in such a way that they appear as a unit.","Elements are connected when they share a common node. Elements 1 and 2 are connected via node 2. If no common node is available, the shear-resistant connection can also be made with a zero element. For a zero element, the normal thickness t is zero. The shear thickness t*, on the other hand, must be greater than zero. The specification of a shear thickness t* is required for null elements which are not touched by ""normal"" elements (t > 0) along their entire length. It is recommended to specify the thickness of the thinnest element adjacent to the null element. A null element can be defined manually or created using the ""Join node and element"" function. It must be ensured that the connection is always established via the nodes of the elements and not via the auxiliary points. If elements are to be connected with profiles, the profiles must first be created using the ""Profile break down into elements"" into the individual elements. This is also shown in the video."
The building I calculate is located in the North German Plain. How can I take the increased snow load approach into account?,"When selecting the design situation ""Extraordinary - Snow - North German Lowland"", the coefficient for extraordinary snow loads (Cesl= 2.30) is automatically taken into account when generating the load combinations. This design situation is usually generated in addition to the general design situations (ULS, GZG).Whether a building is located in the North German lowlands can be easily determined by entering the location data with the geozone tool Snow load zones, wind zones and earthquake zones can be checked on our homepage."
"After using the DYNAM Pro module, I get the warning message during the calculation: ""Inadmissible addition of load cases in a result combination!"" What does that mean?","The message about the inadmissible addition of load cases is to be regarded as a warning: it appears as soon as load cases of a nonlinear system (e.g. with tension members) are superimposed in an EK.Ultimately, a different static system, since different members are effective. In DYNAM Pro, your system is linearized when using the response spectrum method. Therefore, this message always appears when nonlinear elements exist in the model."
How can I show only the section names in the section color panel without norm and steel grade?,"If the colors are set according to the ""Cross-section"" setting in the Show navigator, then by default the panel (and also the tables) shows the full cross-section designation, ie cross-section name, standard and material. If you only want the profile designations in the panel, you can disable the full section designation in the ""Program options"" dialog. "
Why aren't my custom colors used for the cross-sections in the printout report?,"Presumably, different colors are specified for the screen display and printout.Call the ""Display Properties"" dialog via the RFEM/RSTAB menu ""Options → Display Properties → Edit"". You can then specify the appropriate settings for the screen and the printout for each category, for example for the cross sections.If both representations are to be identical, the Set for screen and printout report. All entries that are then made in the settings then apply equally to the screen view and the printout report."
How can straight stairs and spiral stairs be created in RFEM and RSTAB?,Modeling can be easily done with the model generator. There is a stair generator for straight and spiral stairs in the Extras-->Model Generate menu. 
How do I define temperature loads on a composite beam?,"The temperature load case is very important in composite construction. A distinction is made here between the load cases: heating at the top (due to concreting) and heating at the bottom. Since a temperature change must be defined here, the load is defined as Delta T. Often a composite beam is modeled using an eccentric member coupled to a surface. To do this, the difference in temperature between these two elements (surface and member) must be divided. The load on the member is defined as member load with the temperature difference times the height of the member divided by the total height of the composite section ( $\triangle T\times\frac{h_s}{h_g}$). If the upper fibers of the rod are colder than the lower ones, the value must be defined negatively. Finally, the remaining temperature difference is applied to the surface . Care must be taken to define the temperature of the bar as Tc on the surface and to apply the temperature that is still missing as delta T to the surface. "
How do I send files to support that are too large to email?,"It is best to save the file without results and without printout reports. The best way to do this is to save a copy of the file and deactivate the results (incl. FE mesh - only RFEM) and the printout reports in the subsequent dialog. In the actual ""Save"" dialog there is also a function to save the file in compressed form. The file size is again significantly reduced. If the file is still too large or you do not want support to delete the results or printout logs for reasons of better traceability, you can also submit your request via our website. To do this, follow the link below, which will take you to the ""Report a problem or error"" page. This allows you to upload files up to 2GB in size. Of course, you can also use your own file hosting service and include the link to the file in the email."
"What is the best way to model two parallel, welded bars?","The following options are available for modeling two parallel, welded rods: 1) Connection of the two bars by means of rigid bars at certain intervals: Division of the bars at certain intervals: right-click on the corresponding rods → ""Split rod""Connect the newly created nodes using rigid rods 2) Decomposition of a member into a surface (only possible in RFEM): Right click on one of the members → ""Dissect member into surfaces""Move the other member into a plane of the newly created surfaces so that the line of the moved member in the corresponding surface is integrated (control: ""Edit surface"" dialog window → ""Integrated"" tab)Definition of a member eccentricity so that the original position is restored (""Edit member"" → ""Settings"" tab → ""New member eccentricity"" → practical here: ""Relative offset"")If the member, which has now been broken down into surfaces, is to be designed in an additional module, you can simply add Results bar must be defined 3) Use of the Individual program SHAPE-THIN to model and measure individual cross-sections"
Where can the deformation coefficient kdef (EN 1995-1-1) or the creep coefficient φ (SIA 265) for long-term deformations be changed with automatic load combinations.,"Since the shares from creep for the verification in the serviceability limit state are taken into account directly on the side of the load combinatorics, the service class and thus the deformation coefficient must also be defined in RFEM or RSTAB independently of the design module. This is already done in the basic data, but can also be called up directly from the combination rules."
I can no longer open a file because it appears to be corrupt. Can I still save the data?,"In order not to have to start from the beginning in the event of a defective file, it is worth taking a look at the backup files that the program automatically creates. There are two different backups, which here in more detail. If these do not help, you can send us the defective file. It may be possible to save it."
Which explicit method is used in the module RF-DYNAM Pro – Nonlinear Time History?,"In addition to an implicit NEWMARK solver for the mean acceleration, an explicit solver is also available in the add-on module RF-DYNAM Pro – Nonlinear Time History.It should be noted here that the ""original"" variant of the central difference method is not used but a modified form. The modification is characterized by the fact that the approach to the speed difference is not a central difference. The following two equations show the applied differences in speed and acceleration:Speed: (no central difference) ${\dot{\mathrm x}}_{\mathrm n+1/2}=\frac{{\mathrm x}_{\mathrm n+1}-{\mathrm x} _\mathrm n}{{\mathrm{Δt}}_{\mathrm n+0.5}}$Acceleration: (central difference)${\ddot{ \mathrm x}}_\mathrm n=\frac{{\dot{\mathrm x}}_{\mathrm n+0.5}-{\dot{\mathrm x}}_{\mathrm n-0, 5}}{{\mathrm{Δt}}_\mathrm n}$This approach leads to faster convergence, since the reaction to changes in the load or system changes (non-linearities) is ""faster"". . FAQ 2356 explains when the explicit analysis should be selected described in detail."
"In RF-PUNCH Pro, base stresses are not deducted from wall ends and wall corners, although the ""Foundation"" type is set. It is also nowhere possible to set that the base stresses should be deducted. Why is that?","If you carry out a punching shear check for a wall corner or a wall end on a floor or foundation plate, this input is not required. Because with a punching shear check If the punching shear load is determined from the shear forces in the critical perimeter at a wall corner or wall end, the portion of the area load within the critical perimeter (up to the load introduction) is missing anyway. This means that this input is not required in dialog 1.5 either. If, on the other hand, you carry out the punching analysis for an individual column on a foundation plate with the punching load from the normal force of this column, then then At the end of the dialog ""1.5 Punching Accounts - Punching Account Details"" the input option for the ""Area Load to be Deducted"" appears, with which ΔVEd can be determined. "
"have modeled a floor slab as an ""orthotropic surface"". Can I now also use these surfaces in the reinforced concrete design?","Yes, you can use ""orthotropic surfaces"" for the reinforced concrete design in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces. If you only want to perform the ultimate limit state design, you do not have to make any further settings in RF-CONCRETE surfaces with regard to the surface type. You need the RF-CONCRETE NL add-on module for the serviceability limit state design. In the ""Serviceability"" tab (in the ""1.1. General data"" dialog box), select the ""Nonlinear..."" design method. In the ""1.3 Surfaces"" dialog you can then change the surface type to ""Constant"" so that a design in the serviceability limit state is also possible."
How can I enter a uniaxially spanned floor slab in RFEM?,"You can simulate uniaxially stretched ceiling slabs (e.g. element ceilings) using the ""orthotropy"" of the surfaces. You can select the ""Orthotrop"" stiffness type in the dialog Set ""Edit surface"" separately for each surface. In the ""Edit surface stiffness - orthotropy"" dialog you can determine the orthotropy type and here e.g. B. Select ""Effective Thicknesses"". In the ""Effective Thicknesses"" tab, you can then define the effective thickness in the local x and local y directions of the respective surface. Furthermore, in this dialog you will also find the option to define an effective thickness for the self-weight."
Can containers be analyzed statically with Dlubal software?,"With the FEM statics software RFEM, containers (shipping containers, office containers, residential containers, etc.) can be structurally calculated and dimensioned. In RFEM, member, surface and Volume elements available. All steel components can be dimensioned in the corresponding add-on modules."
Why are the wind and snow load generators greyed out in my model?,"The prerequisite for the two generators is the use of the model type 3D. In the case of a 2D model, the program does not have the required geometric parameters.The model type is defined within the basic data of the model. The corresponding dialog can be called up in the data navigator by right-clicking on ""Model data"" and then via the context menu option ""General information"". If the model type is changed, it may be necessary to adapt the modeling (bearings, joints)."
What is the difference between RSTAB and RFEM?,"RSTAB is a 3D framework software that you can use to calculate 3D and planar frameworks. The powerful calculation engine of RSTAB enables the linear and non-linear calculation of internal forces, deformations and support reactions. With RFEM you extend the member design by plates, disks, shells and volumes according to the finite element method. These elements can be arbitrarily mixed in a structure. RFEM contains almost all functions from RSTAB, which is why pure frameworks can also be calculated with it. The user interfaces and operation of RSTAB and RFEM are almost identical, although many more functions are available in RFEM due to the larger program scope . A transfer of the structure and load data from RSTAB to RFEM and vice versa is possible as long as the objects are supported by both programs. Add-on modules are available in RSTAB and RFEM for the design, which take into account the material and code-specific conditions. Thanks to the modular software concept, a program package can be put together that is tailored to individual requirements. A later upgrade remains possible at any time."
How to change the parameters of a rolled section from the cross-section library?,"If a rolled profile is not available in the cross-section library with the desired dimensions, you can create it yourself.First select the cross-section to be modified and then click on the ""Parametric input"" button. The desired entries can then be made in the dialog that opens. "
You can use the Results navigator to display the resultant of all support forces and their components.Is it also possible in RFEM to display the resulting support force of an individual bedded surface?,"Yes, support forces of individual surfaces can be displayed in the RFEM table window in table ""4.21 Surfaces - Contact Stresses"". This table can be called up by right-clicking on one of the tabs in ""4.xx - Results"". In addition to the contact stresses, the corresponding bearing forces are displayed. "
"Where can I set that the component entered is a ""wall"" or a ""ceiling""?","You will find this setting in the ""Basic information"" of the respective model.There you can choose between the ""model types"" ""3D"", ""2D - XY"", ""2D - XZ"" and ""2D - XY"". So if you want to enter a slab as a 2D model and ignore the normal forces in the slab, set the model type to "" 2D - XY"" order. If you want to enter a wall, set ""2D - XZ"". You can find more information on this in the RFEM manual in Section 12.2.1 Basic - Model type. "
Can you give me a hint where I can activate the verification of the limitation of a gaping joint according to DIN 1054: 2010-12 A 6.6.5 in the FUND Pro add-on module?,"To do this, you must first select ""DIN"" as the national appendix in ""Mask 1.1 General data"". After that you can open the [Details...]. There you will find proof of the limitation of the gaping joint, which is dubbed ""foundation twisting""."

Is it possible to define a user-defined cross-section with an inclined main axis in RSTAB or RFEM?,"Yes, this is possible by creating a custom cross section via the cross section library."
How can I split a surface in RFEM?,"RFEM offers two options for dividing surfaces: 1) Dividing the surface evenly The prerequisite for an even division of the surface is that it is four-sided and convex, i.e. none of the four interior angles may be greater than 180°. The function can be called up by right-clicking on the area and using the ""divide area evenly"" command. Finally, the number of divisions in each direction and the individual relative distances are entered in the corresponding ""Division area"" dialog box. 2 ) Divide area using integrated lines If any lines are drawn within the area level, the area can be divided accordingly using these lines. First of all, it must be checked whether the dividing lines are integrated into the area. This is the case by default due to the automatic object recognition. The desired function is then carried out again by right-clicking on the area and using the ""divide area using integrated lines"" command."
How can I take an eccentric load introduction into account?,"Since program version 5.19, the eccentric load introduction can also be taken into account directly via the member loads in RFEM. The eccentric load application can be used for the ""Force"" load type.Alternatively (e.g. in RSTAB) you can also define a coupling using a rigid member to consider external concentrated loads that act eccentrically on the member . The rigid rod is to be connected vertically to the corresponding rod. The length of the rigid member corresponds to the amount of eccentricity.Alternatively, you could enter the torsional moment due to the eccentric load introduction as an external load (also for eccentrically acting member loads). The eccentric effect would then be taken into account and the definition of a rigid member would not be necessary."
How can I use DICKQ cross-sections for haunched members?,"In order to use DICKQ cross-sections for haunched members, two conditions must be met.1. The ""stresses in stress points"" option must be deactivated in the basic data of the DICKQ position.2. The nodes (corners) of the cross-sections used for the haunch must have the same arrangement in both cross-sections."
Can smoothing areas also be defined on curved surfaces?,"In order to define a smoothing area on curved surfaces, the projection direction must be clearly defined. This is not possible for the ""Perpendicular"" option, so you can define the direction yourself. Either along the global axes X,Y and Z or using a vector."
Is it correct that the permissible ground pressure is to be entered as a characteristic value in FOUNDATION Pro in the input mask 1.1 Basic data? Is the design value determined automatically?,"Yes, this is correct. The characteristic value of the ground pressure is to be entered in the input mask 1.1 General data. The design value is: ${\mathrm\sigma}_\mathrm{Rd}\;=\;{\mathrm\sigma}_\mathrm{Rk}\ ;/\;\;{\mathrm\gamma}_{\mathrm R;\mathrm v}$ You can find the applied partial safety factor for shallow foundations in the parameters of the National Annex that you selected for the design. "
Two solution methods are available for the nonlinear time history analysis in the RF-/DYNAM Pro module. What is the difference between the two?,"In the add-on module RF-DYNAM Pro – Nonlinear Time History Analysis, two different methods are available for nonlinear dynamic analyses: the explicit central difference method and the implicit Newmark analysis of the mean acceleration.Nonlinear Implicit Newmark Analysis Nonlinear Newmark Analysis is an implicit method that solves for unknown values at time i+1 relative to values at time i and i+1. This method is unconditionally stable numerically, regardless of the time step length chosen. This is one reason why this method is mostly preferable for dynamic stresses that act over a longer period of time.Explicit AnalysisExplicit analysis is unique because it values independently of the unknown values at time i+1. However, this is one reason why the explicit analysis is only stable if the chosen time step is smaller than a certain, critical time step. The calculation time of a single time step is very short, but countless, very fine time steps may be necessary to get a result at all.The explicit solver is therefore to be preferred if you have to choose very fine time steps anyway to get a usable (converging) result. This is the case, for example, with very short-term and abruptly changing stresses, such as impact or explosion loads.ConclusionIn summary, it can be said that in the non-linear area both methods ""only"" are numerically stable, although it is still the case that the implicit Newmark analysis is more stable than the central difference method in most cases.It should be noted, however, that even with the Newmark analysis on one is sufficient small time step must be taken into account in order to achieve exact results. Which time step should be selected in a dynamic calculation is specified in FAQ 2655 explained in detail.More information, especially on the critical time step in the explicit analysis, can be found in the RF-DYNAM Pro manual."
"In the RF-CONCRETE Surfaces add-on module, is it also possible to limit crack widths due to internal constraints and with an individually adjusted fct,eff?","In order to determine the minimum reinforcement from restraint (dissipation of hydration heat) in RF-CONCRETE surfaces, you must select at least one load case or CO for the design in window 1.1 in the ""Serviceability"" tab. By default, the analytical proof of serviceability is activated in this tab. Now that you have activated the serviceability limit state design, you can adjust the settings for this in the 1.3 Surfaces window. To do this, you must click on the ""Limitation of crack widths"" tab in the 1.3 Surfaces window. exchange. There you will find the ""minimum reinforcement from compulsion"" on the right-hand side. If ""Cracking with certainty within the first 28 days"" is ticked, the factor for controlling fct,eff,As,min can be entered."
How can the default settings for the units be changed so that they are preset for each new file.,"The default settings are loaded for each new file. If you want to change this, you have to create a new profile after making the desired changes and set this as ""Standard"". If you now start with a new file, this setting is saved. Several profiles can also be created, which can then be read in and managed."
"How can the cross-sections of a haunched beam, which consists of several members, be changed afterwards?","When subsequently dividing a beam with variable cross-sectional dimensions, it is no longer possible to simply change the dimensions for the beam start and beam end. Due to the resulting intermediate nodes, a new cross-section would have to be calculated for each bar segment. So that this does not have to be done by hand, it is advisable to delete the members. It should be noted that only the selected members are deleted and not their nodes. The new member can then be modeled again from the beginning of the beam to the end of the beam and connected to the intermediate nodes using the ""Connect Members"" tool. Summary : 1. Delete members (nodes must be preserved)2. Insert a new member from the beginning of the beam to the end of the beam3. Connect member with intermediate nodes In RSTAB, the members must always be connected to one another in a node. This is not absolutely necessary in RFEM, since a node can lie on a line here without dividing the member. It is therefore sufficient to change the cross-section at the start and end of the beam. If the intermediate nodes (to which members are already connected) already exist and the haunched member is to be created in RFEM later, it is advisable to deactivate the ""Connect members automatically"" option. After that, the bar can be created without divisions at the intermediate nodes."

"Why can't I specify a ""beneficially effective base stress"" in the punching analysis of a floor slab at a wall corner or at a wall end? Where is the entry option for this?","When designing a wall corner or a wall end in RF-PUNCH Pro according to DIN EN 1992-1-1, you do not have to enter the opposing soil pressure separately.Reason: The module calculates the punching load when verifying a wall corner or a wall end from the integration of the shear forces in the critical perimeter.This means that the part of the ground pressure within the critical perimeter is not used to determine the punching shear force anyway, so it does not have to be deducted separately. The situation is different if you analyze the punching through from a single column.The normal column force for the punching load is applied there by default. In this case, you can also specify a soil pressure under the floor or foundation plate. You can find the input option for this in mask 1.5 of the RF module -STANZ Pro. The size of the distributed load to be subtracted can be determined in RFEM by evaluating the contact stress σz determined from the relevant load case or the relevant combination and entered manually in mask 1.5 in the module."
want to define a constant temperature load over the section height. Why can't I select the load direction in the local x-direction of the member?,The load parameter Tc must be defined for constant heating/cooling of the cross-section (membrane portion). This automatically creates a change in length along the x-axis. The x direction does not have to be defined explicitly.The load parameter ΔT describes the temperature difference from the top of the bar to the underside of the bar (bending portion). This can be defined in the y or z direction.
"When selecting the member type, why are there no failing members (tension member, compression member, buckling member) available?","You have created a 2D system with plate action [2D - XY (uZ/φX/φY)]. Here the failures are not activated and are therefore not required. Therefore, these member types are not available."

What are the optimal hardware requirements for RSTAB and RFEM?,"​Basically, it is difficult to make a general statement about the optimal hardware. It always depends on what you want to calculate for models. The following information will help you to configure a computer that is optimally suited for your purposes.ProcessorThe RFEM calculation benefits from several calculation cores. However, the rule here is that more cores are not always better. When computing is spread across a large number of cores, data traffic increases and the connections between cores and memory become more of a bottleneck.Research has shown that for the calculation in RFEM, a maximum of 10 to 12 cores make sense. The current eight-core processors are a good compromise between performance and price. XEON CPUs do not have any advantage over desktop CPUs in our software, quite the opposite. In many situations, RFEM can only use one core. The calculation core of RSTAB also uses only one core. In order to achieve good performance here, a high turbo clock frequency is important. With XEON processors, this tends to be lower than with desktop processors.Specifically, we recommend one of the following processors:Intel® Core™ i9-10920X Intel® Core™ i9-10900XIntel® Core™ i9-10885H Intel® Core™ i9-10980HK Intel® Core™ i9-10900KF Intel® Core™ i9-10900KIntel® Core™ i9-10900FIn principle, processors from Intel are recommended. We don't have any personal experience with the Ryzen processors.Modern processors have a sophisticated temperature management system. The clock frequency is dynamically adjusted depending on the temperature in the processor. This means that good cooling of the processor can improve performance. That's why we recommend a generously sized computer case and a good fan for the processor.RAMA fast connection to the main memory is important for speed. For this reason, DDR4 RAM should always be used.In RFEM, the optimal size of the RAM depends on the FE mesh of the model and in RSTAB on the number of members. Unfortunately, the size of the necessary memory cannot be directly deduced from the number of FE nodes or members. Only testing helps.We recommend equipping the computer with 16 GB of RAM first. It makes sense to equip the mainboard with RAM in such a way that an easy upgrade is possible.Make sure that all memory channels are used.ECC memory, as shown in offered by some workstations, has no benefit for RFEM and RSTAB in terms of speed.Graphics cardFor the graphics card, we recommend a graphics chip from Nvidia. The integrated graphics processors from Intel are not suitable.We advise against Quadro cards and instead recommend a ""games card"" from the GTX series with Pascal architecture (GTX 10XX) or the RTX series with Turing architecture (RTX 20XX). In terms of hardware, there is hardly any difference between gaming and Quadro cards. Experience has shown that the drivers for the game cards work with fewer problems in relation to RFEM / RSTAB and the cards are cheaper than the Quadro cards.The size of the memory on the card is not relevant for RFEM / RSTAB.It is important that the current driver for the graphics card is installed.To avoid complications, it would be good to deactivate the graphics chip integrated in the main processor in the BIOS. Otherwise, RFEM / RSTAB must be assigned to the NVIDIA chip in the NVIDIA control panel.Mass storageA quickly connected SSD (if possible NVMe) makes sense. In terms of computing speed, however, this only brings an advantage in exceptional cases. However, opening and saving large files is faster. SoftwareThe software that is otherwise running in the background can be crucial for the computing speed.Anti-virus software running in the background can slow down the calculation considerably . RFEM and RSTAB have to write many files to and read from the working folder during the calculation. Excluding this folder from the real-time monitoring of your antivirus software could have a positive effect on the computing speed.BIOS updateCustomer experiences have shown that the firmware on the motherboard did not run optimally on a computer equipped with a lot of RAM. This led to a significantly reduced computing speed. If you are using a very new board then you should check if a BIOS update is available."
What is the impact on the design if loads are grouped into the action category Gq permanent/imposed load (1.C)?,"The action category ""permanent/payload"" arose from a customer request. This is not part of the EN 1990.With this, permanent payloads, e.g. B. Floor construction or similar. with the partial safety factor of 1.35 instead of 1.5. All combinations are generated first without this load case ""permanent/live load"" and once with this load case. Example:LF1 --> ContinuousLF2 --> Continuous/PayloadLF 3--> payload 1LF 4--> Payload 2 Result LK1 --> 1.35*LF1 LK2 --> 1.35*LF1 + 1.35*LF2 LK3 --> 1.35*LF1 + 1.5*LF3 LK4 --> 1.35*LF1 + 1.5*LF3 + 1.5*LF4 LK5 --> 1.35*LF1 + 1.5*LF4 LK6 --> 1.35*LF1 + 1.35*LF2 + 1.5*LF3 LK7 --> 1.35*LF1 + 1.35*LF2 + 1.5*LF3 + 1.5*LF4 LK8 --> 1.35*LF1 + 1.35*LF2 + 1.5*LF4"
would like to apply an overhanging reinforcement to an area that should improve the load application and reduce the stress peaks in the contact area. How can I do this with as little effort as possible? ,"Of course, the easiest way would be to insert an opening for the area that is to be reinforced and then close this opening again with a thicker area (area thickness + thickness of reinforcement). The easiest way to do this is as follows:1. First create all boundary lines2. Creation of the first area with the outermost boundary lines, if this does not already exist3. Create an opening where the inner surface will later lie4. Lay out the inner surface5. Possibly create further openings within the inner surface With this modeling, however, one would have the contact between the surface and the reinforcement (possibly tension failure ) not considered. A more realistic consideration of z. B. via contact volumes would be more time-consuming in terms of modeling depending on the model. However, this provides the more accurate results. You can find a link to an article on contact volume modeling at the bottom. "
Which shape functions does RFEM 5 use for 1.) solid elements and 2.) shell elements? Are they linear or quadratic shape functions?,"Generally we use identical bilinear approach functions with 2, 3 or 4 edge nodes depending on which element you use there but differences in squaring. The differences in squaring are as follows:Elastic calculation: Truss: analytic 2 nodes 3 degrees of freedom Beam: analytic 2 nodes 6 degrees of freedom Surface ( plate): analytical (LYNN-DYLON element)Area (wall): 4-sided Gaussian quadrature 2x2, 3-sided selective quadrature (epsilon_x; epsilon_y ; gamma_xy) Volume: Gaussian quadrature 2x2 Nonlinear calculation (e.g. plasticity, etc.): Bars:in the longitudinal direction of the bar 2-point Gaussian quadratureover the cross section 2x2 Gauss quadrature Area (slab):in the element area: 2x2 Gaussian quadrature 4-sided, 3-point Gaussian quadrature 3-sided per thickness 9-point Gauss-Lobatto quadrature Wall – 2x2 Gaussian quadrature, 3-point Gaussian triangular Volume - 14-point reduced Gaussian quadrature (equivalent to 3x3x3 Gaussian quadrature)"

How can identical line hinges be defined on several surfaces at the same time?,"Line joints can be efficiently assigned using the ""Assign to lines graphically"" function. This function can be called up via the ""Insert → Model data → 1.10 Line joints → Assign to lines graphically"" menu. "
"If I arrange eccentric rods on a surface, is that the same as when I actually weld a flat bar to the sheet metal, which is welded around the entire circumference, i.e. is rigidly connected to the sheet metal?","When modeling stiffeners (ribs), there are a few things to consider. I have attached a test model to the e-mail.Generally, with flat surfaces, objects lying in the surface (i.e. lines and nodes) are automatically integrated into the surface. For curved surfaces, this must be done manually. In the model on the left, I removed the line from the surface manually. As a result, the line is only connected to the surface at the node points.For the following models 2 and 3, the lines are already automatically integrated into the surfaces. This means that the member is rigidly connected to the surface over its entire length.The 4th model is modeled using surfaces and largely delivers the same results as with members. I would not define the stiffeners as the ""rib"" member type, since these are primarily reserved for the reinforced concrete design (design as a T-beam)."
How can I create a section through a solid in order to evaluate the results at any point?,"By default, you only see the results for solids on the boundary surfaces. In order to also be able to evaluate the results in the solid, a section or several sections must be created. The ""On the intersection of the solid in the graphic"" function is suitable for this. Next, the edge points A and B are defined, although these can also be outside the structure. In order to be able to view the result of the section, it is advisable to deactivate the results of the solids. "
"In the RF-CONCRETE Surfaces program, there are problems with the graphical representation of the required reinforcement. This is represented unrealistically with higher values in some areas. The progression does not match the torque progression. What can I do in this case?","Please check the settings in window 1.4 ""Longitudinal Reinforcement"" tab. Is the option ""Approach of the largest value from required and existing longitudinal reinforcement (basic and additional reinforcement) per reinforcement direction"" for the longitudinal reinforcement for the lateral force analysis. is set and an existing basic reinforcement is also defined, the results can lead to a locally increased required reinforcement. The reason for this can be explained as follows: If shear force reinforcement can be avoided using the basic reinforcement, then the basic reinforcement is set as ""required"", since the results of the shear force verification only result if the basic reinforcement is actually designed."
The COM specific *.dll and *.tlb files were not properly updated. What can I do?,Probably the *.dll and *.tlb files on your computer have not been updated correctly. Please proceed as follows:1.

How can I avoid singularities in point loads?,"There are various ways of introducing loads cleanly into the warehouse.Since the bearing is not point-shaped in reality, a rigid surface with the size of the bearing is ideal for load introduction. The use of rigid members or couplings is also suitable. An example where a bar should transfer the load in the middle of a surface. Here the transition was modeled with a frame made of rigid rods. Alternatively, a rigid surface can also be used. However, it should be noted that a cross made of rigid rods should be used for the transmission of moments."
"What is the difference between the two member types ""rib"" and ""eccentric beam member""?","The member type ""rib"" is primarily suitable for reinforced concrete elements, since the contribution of the slab is usually taken into account in the design. When defining the ""rib"" member type, the integration of the internal forces due to the plate contribution takes place in the program.If you decide on the ""rib"" member type, note the activation/deactivation of the effective contribution of the surface, see project ""Show"", ""Results"" navigator.If internal forces are only required for the member without considering the plate contribution, then select the member type ""eccentric beam member"".In the design With the help of an add-on module, the same results are obtained for the member type ""rib"" as for an eccentric beam member."

"Not all loads are accepted with the ""Adopt support reactions as loads"" function.","The problem is due to minor inaccuracies in both models. If support reactions are transferred from one model to another, then these are exported as 'free loads' with fixed coordinates. If the coordinates do not match 100%, it can happen that support reactions are not taken into account in edge areas if the corresponding objects are slightly next to the surface. The geometric relationships can be checked quickly by displaying ""Full accuracy"" for the nodes and loads. Often it is helpful to regenerate the model and, in doing so, the node coordinates e.g. B. Round to six decimal places. This function can be called up via the ""Extras → Regenerate model"" menu.Another solution would be to extend the boundary lines of the surfaces into which the loads are to be imported a few millimeters from the outside postpone. This ensures that all free loads are within the areas to be loaded."

The calculation of a result combination in STEEL EC3 or aluminum takes a long time. Why is that and how can I improve the performance?,"The reason for the very long design in STEEL EC3 and ALUMINUM can be cross-sections of the ""General"" type. You can see these in mask 1.3 Cross-sections. For these cross-sections it is necessary to calculate the stresses for the cross-section classification with SHAPE-THIN in the background. The result combination (EK) for the design may contain a large number of load combinations (LK), which is why the SHAPE-THIN calculation is then carried out very often and takes a long time. However, there is a workaround. The enveloping internal forces of the EK are used and not every LC contained in the EK is calculated. While this may be more conservative, it is faster since not every LK requires a SHAPE-THIN computation, only the envelope. "

"During the RFEM calculation, the task manager only shows a utilization of around 50%. Why doesn't the calculation use all cores?","The calculation uses all cores. However, some processors (Intel Core i7, i9, XEON...) support so-called Hyper Threading. This means that each physically existing processor core is split into two virtual cores for the applications. This should make better use of the individual units of the core. There are some applications that benefit from it and run faster. However, this is usually not the case with the calculation core of RFEM. For this reason, the RFEM calculation core usually only uses the cores that are physically available and the task manager indicates that the processor is apparently only being used to 50%."
"How can I design a slab with beams using RF-CONCRETE NL? I want to know the deformations in state II. However, this does not seem to work with the entered rib members. Is there an alternative input option?","It is correct that the rib members defined in the model are not taken into account when calculating the realistic deformations in state II. You can solve this problem, however, by not representing the beams as rib members, but replacing them with a surface model. This means that the entire slab can be mapped as a surface structure and designed with RF-CONCRETE NL in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces."
How can I determine the resulting force of a surface support or its contact stress in RFEM?,"There has been a useful function for some time that shows the resultant of the contact stress per area. These resulting contact stresses are therefore output in the result tables of the contact stress areas (Table 4.21) in columns F, G and R. Alternatively, one could also ""manually"" determine the resultant. If your model contains a uniform FE mesh, of whose elements the area can be determined, you can export the determined values of the contact stresses from RFEM and multiply them by the area of the finite elements to obtain the resulting forces per element. In order to obtain the total resultant force of a surface bearing, the individual resultants must be summed up. Since the values of the contact stresses in Table 4.21 are output per grid point, it makes sense to adjust the grid of the surface so that a grid point is always as close as possible to the middle of a finite element. The grid of the area can be adjusted via ""Edit area"" in the ""Grid"" tab."
Why do I get so many unmeasurable points for the solid walls?,"In the case of wall-type beams, I would recommend not optimizing the internal forces. This reduces the number of non-measureable points. The other points are, as far as I could see, singularity points. (Message 5 concrete pressure zone exceeded in the concrete module indicates this.) Here only a finer discretization of these corner areas remains to be carried out via a mesh refinement. This reduces the unmeasurable areas. You could then also define a smoothing area in these areas."

"get internal sizes that I don't expect, because they are e.g. B. do not correspond to the joint definitions. What is the reason?","In the calculation parameters of RFEM and RSTAB, there is the option “Relate internal forces to deformed structure” for each load combination and each load case. The prerequisite for this is the calculation according to the 2nd order theory. The meaning of this is to be explained using the simple example of a loaded cantilever (see picture). The load on the cantilever causes a small twist at node 3. If the calculation is based on the second order theory, you can use this option to decide whether the internal forces at this node are related to the original or to the rotated coordinate system. If the system is initially calculated according to the 1st order theory, the following internal forces result (RO 101.6×3.6, S235): Nx = 0 Vy = 0 Vz = 3.00 kN Mx = 0 M y = 9.00 kNm Mz = 0 The forces and moments can each be understood as a vector (formula 1 and formula 2 ). At node 3, there is a rotation according to formula 3. The local member axis system is therefore rotated by the angle φy at this point. Now the internal forces are to be converted to the rotated coordinate system. This is done by multiplying the vector with the so-called rotation matrix (http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotationmatrix). becomes. The rotation matrix for rotation around the y-axis is shown in formula 4. The conversion is carried out using formulas 5 and 6. Inserting the numbers gives formula 7. It turns out that a small part of the shear force becomes a tensile force: N x = 0.4326 kN Vy = 0 Vz = 2.969 kN The moment vector remains unchanged. You can check the calculation for this simple case as shown in formula 8. This explains what the tick in the calculation options does. But what are the “right” cutting sizes? In any case, the internal forces related to the rotated coordinate system are more precise. However, small torsions are a prerequisite for the calculation according to the second order theory. So the results must not deviate significantly. If they do, then the calculation must be based on the III. order theory. Large rotations are also permitted and the results are always related to the rotated coordinate system. For calculations based on the 1st order theory, the internal forces are always related to the original coordinate system."

Can I display the equivalent loads generated by the add-on module RF-/DYNAM Pro - Equivalent Loads?,"With the RF-/DYNAM Pro - Equivalent Loads module, the multimodal response spectrum analysis is carried out. Equivalent loads are created, which are exported to load cases in the main program RFEM or RSTAB. Load cases are created separately for each selected mode shape and excitation direction. The loads can be displayed as usual. Equivalent loads are generated at each finite element node (or each inner node). If the number of generated loads is too large, the graphical representation is disabled. You can change this setting in the details of the add-on module RF-/DYNAM Pro. "
"With ""free loads"" the sum of the loads does not match the sum of the support reactions! Is this a bug?","Free loads are not tied to an object when they are created.

What tools are available for a pushover analysis?,"In RFEM it is possible to determine a pushover curve or capacity curve and to export it to Excel. The following are the steps that need to be performed:Definition of nonlinear hinges:Plastic hinge according to FEMA 356: A nonlinear hinge (elastic-plastic or rigid-plastic) with preset yield properties and acceptance criteria for steel bars (Chapter 5 of FEMA 356). The yield point values depend on the member and are automatically preset. The diagram parameters are interpolated depending on the cross-section type. The ""FEMA"" hinges can be customized. Plastic hinge according to EN 1998-3: Bilinear definition of the flow curve. The bilinear hinges also have preset yield properties, acceptance criteria, and yield limits, but can be adjusted manually. The use of the plastic hinges has the advantage of a colored representation of the hinges when evaluating the individual load steps. For example, exceeding an acceptance criterion can be quickly recognized.As an alternative to the definition of a hinge, there is the member nonlinearity ""Plastic hinge"" in RFEM. A perfectly plastic behavior can be defined here; the plastic limit values must be entered manually. The advantage of this option is that the position of the forming plastic hinge is found automatically. Definition of load schemes for nonlinear analysis : This can be done manually by entering loads in a load case, for example an evenly distributed load over the building height.A load distribution analogous to the mode shape can be automatically generated with the RF-DYNAM Pro Equivalent Loads module. This module determines eigenvalues and equivalent loads based on the response spectrum method. Equivalent loads are generated for each selected eigenvalue and exported to RFEM in load cases.Load increase in RFEM: A load increase can be defined in the calculation parameters of the load cases. The results of all load levels can be analyzed. Especially when using the ""plastic joints"" you can evaluate the plastification by the colored marking of the joints. It is important to scale the exported equivalent loads (from RF-DYNAM Pro) so that the loads are not increased in too large steps. A load case as exported from RF-DYNAM Pro. Calculation diagrams for creating the pushover curve: find them in the ""Global Calculation Parameters"". You can define the total seismic load on the vertical axis and the deformation in roof plane on the horizontal axis and thus get the desired pushover curve. This data can easily be exported to Excel. You can use the color scale to visualize the Select acceptance criteria or according to the defined joint diagram parameters. You can then carry out the further pushover analysis (determination of the inelastic spectrum, performance point) in Excel, for example. In the download area you will find this manual described in more detail in a PDF document (in English)."
My model is unstable. What can be the cause? ,"A calculation abort due to an unstable system can have various reasons. On the one hand, it can indicate real instability due to system overload, but on the other hand, modeling errors can also be responsible for the error message. Below is a possible procedure to find the cause of the instability.First it should be checked whether the modeling of the system is correct. A good tool for finding problems in the modeling are the model checks (menu ""Extras"" → ""Model check"").Furthermore, you can calculate the model in a first-order load case under pure self-weight. If results are then output, the structure is stable in terms of modeling. If this is not the case, the most common causes are listed below :Supports are missing or have been defined incorrectlyMembers can change their own Rotate the axis because a corresponding bearing is missingMembers are not connected to each other (""Extras"" → ""Model control"")Nodes are apparently in the same place, but on closer inspection they differ slightly from each other (frequent cause with CAD import, ""Extras"" → ""Model check"")Bar end hinges/line hinges cause a ""hinged chain""The structure is not sufficiently stiffenedNon-linear structural elements (e.g. tension rods) fail. It is an articulated frame, which is reinforced by tension rods. Due to the shortening of the leg as a result of the vertical loads, the tension rods receive small compressive forces in the first calculation run. They will be removed from the system (since only train can be picked up). In the second calculation run, the model is then unstable without these tension rods. There are several ways to solve this problem: you can apply a prestress (member load) to the tension members and thus ""eliminate"" the small compressive forces, assign a small stiffness to the members or have the members removed one after the other in the calculation.In order to get a graphical representation of the cause of an instability, the module RF-STABLE (RFEM). Unstable systems can be calculated with the option ""Determine mode shape of the unstable model..."". The component that leads to the instability can usually be seen in the graphic. Can load cases and load combinations be calculated according to the 1st order theory and the calculation only breaks when calculating according to the 2nd or 3rd theory. order, then there is a stability problem (critical load factor less than 1.00). The critical load factor specifies the factor by which the load must be multiplied in order for the model to become unstable under the associated load, for example buckling. It follows: A critical load factor smaller than 1.00 means that the system is unstable. In order to be able to find the ""weak point"", the following procedure is recommended, which the module RSBUCK (for RSTAB) or RF-STABLE (for RFEM) requires :First, the load of the affected load combination should be reduced until the load combination becomes stable. The load factor in the calculation parameters of the load combination serves as an aid. Subsequently, based on this load combination, the buckling or buckling figure can be calculated and displayed graphically in the RSBUCK (RSTAB) or RF-STABILITY (RFEM) module. The ""weak point"" in the system can be identified through the graphical output and then optimized in a targeted manner. "
How do I activate or start the RF-/STEEL Warping Torsion module?,"The RF-/STEEL Warping Torsion module is a module extension of the RF-/STEEL EC3 module. The RF-/STEEL Warping Torsion module is activated directly in the EC3 module in the details. The masks are then adjusted accordingly. Since this module is only suitable for sets of members, no members can be selected for the design."
How can I carry out a buckling analysis for a surface in RFEM?,"If you want to carry out a buckling analysis with shell elements, you need the RF-STABILITY, RF-IMP and RF-STEEL Surfaces add-on modules. Determine the governing load according to the first-order theory. The results of the governing LC are then used in RF-STABILITY to determine the lowest eigenmode (local deflection / buckling of the surface). With the result from RF-STABILITY, a pre-deformed structure can be generated in RF-IMP, by scaling the mode shape to a maximum ordinate (maximum value of pre-deformation). The maximum value of the pre-deformation is to be specified by the engineer. Now the governing LC is copied and calculated according to the second-order theory, taking into account the pre-deformed structure of RF-IMP. The results are then used for a stress analysis with RF-STEEL surfaces. The basic procedure is explained again in the attached video. There are already some very interesting technical articles on this topic on our website. "
Can I create punching shear reinforcement in RF-FOUNDATION Pro to increase the punching shear resistance of the foundation slab. Or is it possible to arrange a vertical stirrup reinforcement in RF-FOUNDATION Pro?,"No, in RF-FOUNDATION Pro it is not possible to arrange punching reinforcement. The module first calculates the longitudinal reinforcement required for the bending design of the slab. From this longitudinal reinforcement, the degree of longitudinal reinforcement is determined, which is then used to determine the punching shear resistance of the slab. If the proof of punching shear is not fulfilled, you as the user can customize the existing longitudinal reinforcement in window 2.4 or 2.5 on the reinforcement side and select a different reinforcement proposal with a higher reinforcement content. After a recalculation with the changed reinforcement, you can check in the 2.2 Relevant Checks window whether the increase in the longitudinal reinforcement was effective. If the increase in the longitudinal reinforcement in the foundation plate was not effective, you still have the option of designing with the add-on module RF-PUNCH. In RF-PUNCH, the punctiform punching of foundation slabs can be analyzed. Punching shear reinforcement in the form of vertical or inclined bars can also be used here."

Is there a setting that allows me to use only mesh reinforcement and no reinforcing bars when designing foundation slabs?,"In the 1.3 Materials mask it is not possible to deactivate all reinforcing bars. At least one diameter must be selected here. However, in a first calculation run, you can determine the bending reinforcement required for the foundation plate with this specification. From the results window 2.3 Required reinforcement you can then see which bending reinforcement is to be provided for the foundation plate. You can then specify a user-defined reinforcement in the 2.4 Lower slab reinforcement window. To do this, click the Other reinforcement proposal... button. A new dialog opens in which you can specify that only mesh reinforcement should be applied (no bars). Confirm the change in this dialog with [OK]. If you click in the module navigator after this change, you will receive a message that the calculation must be carried out again due to the change in reinforcement. Confirm this with [Yes]. This will start the calculation again. After the recalculation, you can switch to the 2.7 Steel list mask. Here you can see that only reinforcement meshes were used."
"When designing biaxially spanned slabs in RF-CONCRETE surfaces, I get a minimum reinforcement in both slab directions. Is it possible to set in the module where the minimum reinforcement should be applied?","According to EN1992-1-1, Section 9.3.1, a minimum reinforcement to ensure ductile component behavior must be inserted in the main stress direction of the slab. By default, the option “Reinforcement option with main tensile force in considered element” is selected in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces. This now means that for each element, the largest tensile force is sought for each reinforcement direction and for the slab top (-z) and slab bottom (+z). If the greatest tensile force was found for the individual element, the minimum reinforcement is applied there. If, for example, the minimum reinforcement is only to be arranged in the main direction of stress for biaxially stressed slabs, this can be specifically controlled by the user. To do this, open the “Settings for minimum reinforcement with ductile component behavior” dialog. If you select ""Define"", you can specifically set in which direction and on which side of the component the minimum reinforcement should be arranged."
To what extent does RFEM take the inserted reinforcement into account when determining the stress or internal forces? Is the reinforcement entered only taken into account by the add-on module RF-CONCRETE Surfaces?,"When determining surface stresses or internal forces in RFEM, the reinforcement entered is initially not taken into account. RFEM uses an isotropic, linear-elastic material model here. You also have the option of using the RF-CONCRETE NL module to carry out a non-linear design in the serviceability limit state in the RF-CONCRETE Surfaces module. Here you can define an existing reinforcement before the design. The module determines a nonlinear stiffness taking into account the inserted reinforcement and the cracked state. You can then optionally export this nonlinear stiffness to RFEM and for the Activate recalculation of the surface internal forces for individual load cases and load combinations."
"The stiffness for surfaces, members or cross-sections has been modified, but this is not taken into account in the calculation. How to activate the modification for the calculation?","For targets created prior to X.06. version, the stiffness factors are applied by default only to load combinations, not to load cases. To ensure that the stiffness modification is also used in the load cases, the corresponding option under ""Activate stiffness coefficients"" must be used in the calculation parameters. From version X.06. the stiffness modification is automatically active for new positions."
Can an RFEM file be saved as an RSTAB file?,"RFEM files cannot be saved as RSTAB files. However, RFEM files can be opened directly in RSTAB. In RSTAB, the file type must be set to ""RFEM"" in the ""Open"" dialog. The relevant RFEM file can then be selected and opened. The RFEM file can also be opened via the project manager. To do this, open the ""RFEM"" tab and select the appropriate project. The relevant file can then be opened in RSTAB by selecting the ""Open with ->RSTAB X.XX"" command from the context menu. Please note that not all functions of RFEM are available in RSTAB (e.g. element type ARC, SPLINE, etc.). A message window will alert you to these items."

How are unloaded members treated in the load generator?,"In both cases shown in graphic 1, a total load of 51 kN acts in the global X-direction. The problem is the different distributions in both cases:In variant A the green loads are larger and the red smaller and in variant B it is the other way around. The biggest problem in Variant A is that the red loads are strangely the same size as in the area above, but where there are still the intermediate bars (green load).The problem here is the area framed in yellow. Internally, first the load of the entire area is calculated (51 kN) and then the closed cells (plane which is completely framed by members) are subtracted from it.Because the area framed in yellow does not represent a cell (the limiting bar between nodes 20 and 36), this is a special case. The load generator does the following here:By subtracting the horizontal bars, a large fictitious cell is created between nodes 23,760,36 and 20. Due to the aforementioned missing cell, it is assumed that the outer bars all have a constant load (here 1.6 and 1.0 kN/m) and the rest of the load is distributed to the inner bars. As a result, in Variant A the green load is higher and the red loads are smaller. To modify this distribution, the load generator has the option ""Apply all members"", as shown in graphic 2.This option creates the missing cell internally and distributes the loads according to variant B. There is also an interesting article in our blog:http://www.dlubal.com/blog/9034/dlubal-rfem-5-rstab-8-treatment-of-unloaded-bars- at-the-load-generation/"
How can tension members be treated in RF-/DYNAM Pro?,"Dynamic investigations, such as the determination of natural vibrations or the response spectrum method, are always carried out on linear systems. To avoid non-linearities such as B. To consider tension members in a dynamic analysis, a complex procedure is necessary. This procedure is used for the additional modules natural vibrations and equivalent loads in this technical article .However, you should weigh up whether this complex consideration is necessary for your system or whether linearization is sufficient. In the additional module Nonlinear Time History Tension bars are taken into account as usual. An example is described in this technical article. "

How can I determine the punching shear load and wall ends?,"The wall corners are often singularities and require engineering consideration. Singularities are usually caused by re-entrant corners and large jumps in stiffness. Since this is not a problem in the program, I can only explain one possible procedure for determining the design shear force using an example. As a basis for the example, I use the literature ""Examples for dimensioning according to DIN 1045-1; Volume 1: Building construction (3rd edition)"" from Verlag Ernst & Son. (You can find an excerpt in the appendix)The aim is to determine the design shear force at the critical perimeter. Determine the dimensions of the critical perimeter according to DIN 1045-1, FIgure 38 or FIgure 39 and create these lines in RFEM. So that the generated lines are included in the surface, please click on Calculation → FE mesh settings and then select the following option. If necessary, carry out a mesh refinement.After calculating the decisive load case combination, first select the three straight lines and then click on one of them with the right mouse button. Then select result curves. Now let the results of v-max,b be smoothed with the following settings. Make a note of the smoothed value (209.12 kN/m) and the total length (1.05 m). Now smooth the curved lines analogously to the straight lines. (Only lines of the same type can be selected at the same time in order to display the result curves.) Note the smoothed v-max,b (221.04 kN/m) and the length (0.889m) here as well. With these values, you can now determine the design shear force for the punching proof:vEd = β x (209.12 kN/mx 1.05 m + 221.04 x 0.889 m) / (1.05 m + 0.889 m ) = 289.69 kN/m with β = 1.35 for wall ends and β = 1.2 for wall corners (according to DIN 1045-1; FIgure 44) VEd = 289, 69 kN/m / β x (1.05 m + 0.889 m) = 416.08 kN"
How can I completely uninstall the Dlubal products?,"For a complete uninstallation you need to do the following: 1. Uninstallation of all Dlubal products 2.

The interface is not available in the 64-bit versions of these programs due to the lack of a 64-bit API from OpenOffice.
"What does the calculation note ""Connection with 2 tension zones, 2nd tension zone is calculated in the virtual load case"" mean? ","In several individual verifications (e.g. column flange to bending), the acting bending moments are related to the pressure point. The eccentricity of the normal force is converted into an additional moment. In the case of predominantly tensile forces, the pressure component from the moment is superimposed so strongly that a second tension zone is created instead of the pressure point."
During installation I get the message ʺCould not set file security for file XY. Error 0. Check if you have sufficient privileges to modify security rights on this file.ʺ What does this mean?,"A possible cause of this error message is the specification of network paths for the installation. Unfortunately, installation in a network is not possible."
Why is my cross-section unmeasureable?,"The cause lies less in the defined cross-section than in the material properties. The yield points and limit stresses are stored there depending on the component thickness. Indeterminability occurs when the thickness of a cross-section part is greater than the existing thickness range. You have the following options to remedy this: 1) You can create an additional thickness range with the corresponding stresses in the module in mask 1.2 ""Materials"" 2) Alternatively you can select another material with suitable thickness ranges in the RSTAB/RFEM library"
"What does the calculation note ""No clear direction of rotation of the moment around the pressure point"" mean? ","In several individual verifications (e.g. column flange to bending), the acting bending moments are related to the pressure point. The eccentricity of the normal force is converted into an additional moment. If the compressive forces predominate, the direction of the moment can reverse and the connection is then fully subjected to compressive stress. There is no longer a clear pressure point."
"When exporting to Autodesk AutoCAD Structural Detailing, I get the error ""Load case not found"". What is the cause?","The ""Autodesk AutoCAD Structural Detailing"" interface allows you to export the results of the RF-CONCRETE Surfaces module together with the geometry directly to AutoCAD Structural Detailing. If you have not created an RF-CONCRETE surface case in your model, the error message appears that no load case was found."
"When verifying the plastic load-bearing capacity, I get a magnification factor and a utilization reserve. Which value is important? ","The magnification factor 'alpha plastic': If you multiply all internal forces by this factor, the plastic load-bearing capacity of the cross-section is reached. The utilization reserve only describes the proportion of simplex elements that are not fully utilized. "
How can you deactivate individual internal forces for the design in CONCRETE or RF-CONCRETE Members (for example the torsional moment MT for ribbed members)? ,"In the ""1.6 Reinforcement"" window, you will find the internal forces to be taken into account for the design in the ""Reinforcement arrangement"" tab. Here you can deselect the internal forces that should not be taken into account for the respective reinforcement set. It is important that this setting applies to all bars of the reinforcement set. This function should therefore be chosen with care."

Where can I subsequently reverse the global axis system (alignment of the global Z axis)?,"You can change the orientation of the global Z-axis via ""Edit → Model data → Basic data"". If the orientation is subsequently changed, problems can arise, especially with regard to the applied load. Special caution is therefore required here. "
In RFEM I have divided a member into surfaces. How do I change the previously applied member load so that it now acts on the surface?,"If a member is decomposed into surfaces, the member loads have no effect. The loads need to be redefined.The easiest way is to specify the line where the load is applied (or create a new line in the surface) and assign it a line load. To do this, you can copy the load parameter of the member load from the input table and paste it into the line load worksheet."

"When trying to calculate a result combination, I get the warning 30014:""Inadmissible addition of load cases in result combination! The result combination contains load cases or load combinations with results according to the second order theory , which have nonlinear relationships and therefore cannot be added together.""What does this warning mean?","The warning appears if load cases or load combinations are to be calculated non-linearly according to the second or third order theory and then superimposed in a result combination according to the following definition criteria:Case 1: EK = LK1 + LK2 Since each load combination is analyzed non-linearly according to the second order theory, the superimposition of the respective results is problematic: The deformations and internal forces are based on different static systems. It would not be correct to simply add up the individual LC results.Case 2: EK = 'Factor' * LC1 or 'Factor' * LC2The two load combinations are combined with factors superimposed. Since each LK is calculated according to the second order theory, the results show a non-linear relationship. The factors cause each internal variable to be multiplied by the appropriate factor. For example, a doubling of the normal force does not necessarily correspond to a doubling of the moment. The results are therefore assumed to be linearly related. This contradiction (non-linear calculation of the results with linear multiplication) leads to the warning described.The solution for both cases is to calculate the load cases or load combinations linearly according to the 1st order theory and then convert them into to overlay an EK. If there are only load cases, these can also be analyzed in a load combination.The results of non-linear analyzes can still be superimposed in an EC if the ""constant"" criterion is used: EC = LK1/s or LK2/s. This determines a result envelope that captures the unfavorable constellation from both LKs. In this case, the warning must be confirmed with [Yes]. The EK internal forces then represent the extreme values from the two LCs and can be used for a further design.A similar message appears in the case of a result combination with geometric nonlinearities in the model. It is described in FAQ 003065."

How can the deformation behavior of mixed reinforced concrete structures (members and surfaces) in state II be mapped?,"With the RF-CONCRETE Members and RF-CONCRETE Surfaces modules, you can carry out the design in state II (nonlinear design) separately for members and surfaces. For this you need the RFEM add-on module RF-CONCRETE NL. After you have performed a calculation in state II (for the serviceability state, with non-linear design) in RF-CONCRETE Members or RF-CONCRETE Surfaces, you can export the resulting nonlinear stiffness to RFEM. This non-linear stiffness from the member design or surface design can then optionally be used to calculate the internal forces of individual load cases or load combinations. The procedure described can be used for the separate design of members and surfaces. Unfortunately, this is not exact for a mixed system of members and surfaces, since there is no interaction between the two modules RF-CONCRETE Members and RF-CONCRETE Surfaces. In this case, however, you can display the members as a surface model and use these equivalent surfaces (for the members) for the design in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces. With this ""substitute model"" you can now determine the deformations in state II. Either the RF-CONCRETE NL module (non-linear design) or the add-on module RF-CONCRETE Deflect (analytical method) can be used for this."
How do I take into account the resilience of a cross laminated timber surface in the event of a wall-like load? ,"The resilience of a wooden wall is calculated using the displacement modulus. For a 4 mm nail, a standard C24 wood yields 793.981 N/mm per shear plane. For this, the mean value of the stiffness and the partial safety factor must then be taken into account, which is not taken into account for this example. The distance between the nails used then results in the longitudinal stiffness to be used for the connection."
I want the results from RF-CONCRETE surfaces to be displayed transparently at grid points and now I get very large red points at the grid points.

"would like to display the internal forces at the start and end nodes of the beam in a table for the design of connections. However, the beam consists of several bars, which leads to a very confusing tabular representation. How can this be optimized?","In this case, it is advisable to form a set of members from the individual members of a beam. In the results tables, you have the option (after the calculation) of displaying the internal forces related to the sets of members. The node results can now be displayed using the result filter function. In this way, the desired internal forces are obtained for each start and end node of the set of members. For the documentation, the table can also be exported to Excel and adjusted there if necessary."

I want to support a slab on a linear support where the spring stiffness is linearly variable over the length of the linear support. Is there an option in RFEM to display exactly this case? ,"Unfortunately, there is no way to define a variable spring over the bearing length for line supports. In this case, you should place nodal supports with a sufficiently fine pitch and assign them different spring stiffnesses. If you set nodal supports on a line, a node is always assumed. This node is also an FE constraint node, which means: an FE node is automatically generated at this node."
I would like to use our network license via VPN. What do I have to consider?,"If the client does not automatically find the server in the network (e.g. due to a different subnet or when accessing via a VPN connection), the IP of the server must be entered manually on the client.The You can configure it via the Admin Control Center (ACC), which can be accessed on the client via the following link: http://localhost:1947. Enter the server IP under the Configuration option in the ""Access to Remote License Managers"" tab and confirm with [Submit].Reading in the Author. ini continues to take place on the client and, in addition to the successful installation of the program, is a basic requirement for licensing. The procedure is the same as for local use of the network license. This means that the Author.ini both when you start it for the first time and afterwards via Help > Authorization > Read Authorization File can be read."
Why is wraparound rebar the default and cannot be changed? ,"For the selection of a different reinforcement arrangement, no circular cross-section may exist in the reinforcement set. If bars with a circular cross-section are removed from the reinforcement set, an optimized distribution can be selected again."
"What does the message ""Invalid input or number conversion error R_KT_r.s"" mean? ",This message indicates that the web thickness in the docked beam is less than the top web of the profile. The web thicknesses of the docked cross-section must be at least the same.
"What does the message ""Supported nodes no. 1-4 also lie on supported lines"" mean?","The warning is intended to prevent double support conditions from being accidentally set - once as degrees of freedom at the node (node support) and once as degrees of freedom at the end point of the line (line support). There could be contradictory boundary conditions that are not in the interests of the user.When modeling surface beds, it can make sense to define different stiffnesses for nodal and line supports (see RFEM manual, keyword ""Earth wedge ""). If the storage conditions were deliberately assigned in this way, the message can be acknowledged with ""No"".The warning can be bypassed, e.g. B. A short non-supported line is introduced in front of the supported node."
Is there an error number list with a precise description of the respective problem?,"Unfortunately, such a list does not exist. If you require further information, please contact support."
RF-/DYNAM Pro - Forced Vibrations and RF-/DYNAM Pro - Equivalent Loads perform the multi-modal response spectrum analysis. What are the differences?,"In RF-/DYNAM Pro - Equivalent Loads, a multi-modal response spectrum analysis is performed with export of equivalent loads.1) Static equivalent loads are calculated and exported to load cases. This is done separately for each mode shape and each excitation direction.2) Total seismic forces can easily be determined for each mode shape.3) Random torsional effects can be automatically taken into account. 4) The load cases are calculated in the main program RFEM / RSTAB. Any existing non-linearities are taken into account here, the calculation parameters of the load cases can be adjusted (e.g. calculation according to the second-order theory, deactivation of the non-linearities). 5) Changes in stiffness from the natural vibration cases (ESFs ) are not automatically transferred to the load cases.6) Result combinations are generated individually for each excitation direction (combined modal responses with SRSS or CQC) and for the combination of results from different excitation directions (SRSS, 100% / 30 % (40%)).7) Sign-matched results based on the dominant eigenmode are available, providing clear EKs.8) The results are step-by-step reproducible.In RF-/DYNAM Pro - Forced Vibrations, a multi-modal and multi-point response spectrum analysis is performed. 1) A building can be excited at different supports and in different directions with different response spectra.2) The calculation and superposition takes place within the RF-/DYNAM Pro module. The calculation is linear, non-linearities are not taken into account. Stiffness changes from the ESFs are adopted.3) Only result combinations of the superimposed results are exported."
"selected the ""For screen and printout report"" function in the display properties to get identical displays. However, this is not the case after activation.","This function is a ""recorder function"": everything that is changed after this option is activated will be changed both for the screen and for the printout. With this function it is not possible to synchronize previously changed functions. Only the changes are synchronized."
"When using the RF-/CONCRETE Columns module, do the imperfections of the column have to be defined as a load case in RFEM/RSTAB?","RF-/CONCRETE Columns designs columns using the nominal curvature method, which takes into account the unwanted eccentricity. It is therefore not necessary to define an imperfection load case in RFEM/RSTAB."
Is there a way to display the number of selected objects when making a selection? ,"In order to get an immediate overview of how many and which elements you have selected, a function has been implemented in RFEM and RSTAB: Information about the number of elements is displayed in the context menu of the selected item."
How can I consider beams in cross laminated timber constructions? ,"Beams can be modeled in RFEM on surfaces and member cross-sections. With both systems, curved beams are also possible without any problems. With the curved surface, the member is always generated appropriately with the thickness distance of the surface and the member via the automatic member eccentricity."
"When creating the material Isotropic Masonry 2D, I get a warning that the program authorization failed.","To use the Isotropes Mauerwerk 2D material, the RF-MAT NL add-on module must be licensed. Without this license, only the Isotropic Linear Elastic and Orthotropic Elastic 2D/3D material models are available."
"In RFEM, I calculated a single-nave frame with fixed foot points. The clamping torques of the frame posts are significantly lower than in the statics of the stand or a manual calculation with frame formulas. Is there an explanation?","In the manual calculation, you probably assume that the shear stiffness G·A tends to infinity.The reason for the deviating progression of the internal forces and deformations is usually the consideration of the member shear stiffness, which is activated by default in RFEM/RSTAB. If required, this option can be switched off in the ""Calculation parameters"" dialog."
"Is it possible to use values from cross-sections (e.g. height, width...) for parameterization?","Within the parameterization you have the possibility to access internal values of the model, such as values of a selected cross-section. These are two special formulas. The first formula, CrossSection(), is nested within the GetCsPar(;) formula. CrossSection(n) gets the cross-section from the nth row of the cross-section table as a character string. GetCsPar(""Cross Section""; ""ID"") needs the cross section as a string and the ID of the value to be searched. The ID can be obtained via the info button in the ""Edit parameters"" window. As can be seen, there are a large number of parameters that can be used to apply eccentric loads, for example."
"When starting the program, the error message appears: ""CPPSQLITE_ERROR[1000]: Error in material library file name:...Description: Can't find norm group ""EN""","These two material databases must be synchronized in each program version:- The program-side installed material library ""Materialien.dbd"" with the common materials - The user-defined material library ""Materialien_User.dbd"" The following steps can help to solve the problem: Open the command line with administrator rights Change to the RFEM folderExecute the following command: DBConverter.exe /Material_Synchronize ""C:\ProgramData\ Dlubal\RFEM 5.23\General Data\Materialien.dbd"" ""C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\RFEM 5.23\General Data\Materialien_User.dbd"" The paths must be adjusted of course. It takes a little while for the process to finish. You can check this by looking in the task manager. Alternatively, a new installation is recommended. The first time you try to install the program again, you will be asked whether you want to uninstall it first. Confirm the query and then reinstall the program."
Is it possible to use RF-LAMINATE to design smaller components such as GRP angles? ,"With RF-LAMINATE, GRP surfaces can also be examined. The calculation theory makes it possible to map GRP surfaces well, since the individual layer thicknesses of GRP are very small (laminate theory). RF-LAMINATE is also suitable for small surfaces with a sufficiently fine FE mesh . For the calculation, the module creates its own stiffness matrix, which results from the material properties and the layer thicknesses."
Can I run the Dlubal programs on a Mac?,"The current Dlubal products are approved for use on Microsoft-based operating systems. You can install such an operating system on your Mac in parallel. It should be noted that local licenses (single-user dongles and softlocks) cannot be addressed via parallel desktops. However, using a local USB dongle and using Windows using Boot Camp should work.It should also be noted that the Dlubal programs were developed for x64 processors. Macs with M1 or M2 processors are therefore not supported.We also install the Dlubal software on an ARM version of Windows 10 (installation via Bootcamp on a Mac with M1 and M2 chip). not supported.If a developer version of Windows 10 for ARM with an x64 emulator is used to operate the Dlubal software, the Dlubal Support unfortunately cannot provide you with any assistance with any problems that may arise.At this point we refer to our minimum requirements (especially reference to the x64 processor)."
Is it possible to set custom stiffener spacing for each span of a crane runway girder? ,"Different stiffener spacing in the field can be specified with the Custom option. After clicking in the field in column C, the [...] button is displayed there. Clicking on this button opens a dialog in which the stiffener positions can be specified for the selected field. "
How can I represent the deformation without the initial undeformed model?,The initial model in the deformation view can be hidden from the Model branch in the Show navigator.
How can I change the default printhead?,"The standard printhead is created from the customer data stored in the authorization file. Please let us know the new data if you want to change the standard printhead. You will then receive an updated authorization file from us. We usually send you the authorization file in an email. You also have access to your authorization file via your Dlubal account.

Specify the path where you copied the authorization file and complete the process. Then delete the file ""DlubalProtocolConfigNew.cfg"" and if available also the file ""DlubalProtocolConfig.cfg"". The standard printhead and user-defined printheads that you may have created in the printout report using the Settings → Report header pull-down menu are stored there. In a standard installation, both files are located in the C:\ProgramData directory \Dlubal\Global\General Data. It is advisable to create a backup copy before deleting the files. Please note that deleting the files will also result in the loss of custom printheads that have already been created. "
"When designing a member in RF-/STEEL EC3, there is a difference in the result tables between the moments listed in the design internal forces and the moments used in the check. Where does this difference come from? ","If this difference occurs in the verification bending and compression according to 6.3.3, then the explanation can be found in Eurocode 1993-1-1 6.3.3.(4). There it is written in the explanations of the variables: ""the design values of the applied compressive force and the applied maximum moments"". The emphasis here should be on ""maximum"". As a result, the associated normal forces are applied for a x-location design, but the maximum moments on the member or set of members are applied."
Is a non-linear calculation performed in the RF-/DYNAM Pro add-on module?,"In the additional modules Natural Vibrations, Forced Vibrations and Equivalent Loads, a linear calculation is carried out. Non-linearities, such as failure under tension or non-linear materials, are ignored. Cables or tension members, for example, are replaced by the member type Truss member. This results from the calculation methods: both the natural vibration analysis and the response spectrum method are purely linear methods. The non-linear time history method add-on module offers a non-linear time history method of time diagrams (any excitation of the structure) and accelerograms (excitation of the supports) using an implicit and explicit analysis. Many non-linearities that can be defined in RFEM or RSTAB are taken into account here."
"""gamma"" factor can be taken into account for the assembled wood cross-sections. How is this determined?","The so-called ""gamma factor"" can be determined according to EN 1995-1-1 Annex B. This depends, among other things, on the displacement modulus of the fastener and their distances as well as the span. However, this procedure has limitations. You can therefore also create a pure member model and read off or measure the internal forces directly from there. base/000873"" target=""_blank"">ach contribution. "
Is it possible to find out the most unfavorable load combination in RFEM and RSTAB?,"The most unfavorable load situation for a component or the overall model cannot be determined in advance due to the different design checks (cross-section and stability check, serviceability, etc.).However, RFEM and RSTAB have an algorithm that is used for the defined load cases all possible load constellations are developed according to a specific standard criterion (superimposition of the loads in load combinations or superimposition of the results in result combinations). These load constellations include every eventuality that results from the variable load cases. A design with this combination package ensures that you take the decisive combination into account.The combinatorics are activated if you check the ""Create combinations automatically"" option in the basic data of the model."
How can parameters in the standard National Annexes to the Eurocode be changed individually? ,"For the individual adaptation of the national parameters, a copy from an existing appendix must be created. Based on this copy, all parameters can then be adjusted individually."
Can you change the print heads in the 3D PDF? ,"The log headers of a 3D PDF can be adjusted in the graphic printout settings. To do this, select the ""Edit log header"" button. The standard header is based on the company information stored in the authorization file. "
Can the scale of images be changed later in the log? ,"Images that have already been printed in the report can be changed by right-clicking on the image → ""Properties"". Here you can also change the graphic scale to the desired size afterwards."
Can the reinforcement for the serviceability limit state be determined automatically in RF-CONCRETE surfaces? ,"Yes, apart from the deformation analysis, the reinforcement for the SLS can be determined automatically.You can find the function in the General information under the details of the SLS analysis method."
Can you optimize the cross-sections in RF-/TIMBER Pro? ,"Yes. For a sensible pre-dimensioning of the cross-sections, the cross-sections of the corresponding profile series can be optimized in RF-/TIMBER Pro."
"I want to set manual result values for the surface internal forces, but this doesn't work. A small cross and the label ""AB"" are always displayed when I move the cursor over an area. ","Check whether the faces of the model are displayed as either ""filled"" or ""filled transparent"". If the surfaces are only displayed in ""wire model"", the point at which the result value is to be stored cannot be selected."
"I created a trapezoidal surface load. If I display the load separately, however, constant loads can be seen on the members. How can I change this?","This effect is due to the fact that the ""Correction of the generated loads"" is not active and only average values are determined. You can change the setting by selecting the correction option ""According to moment equilibrium of the total load and the generated member loads"" in the detail settings of the load generator. You can find more information on load correction in Chapter 11.8.1 of the RFEM or RSTAB manual."
How can I get the weld stresses between two surfaces?,"In order to be able to determine the correct stresses, it is necessary to know the local coordinate system of the surface. This can be activated in the display navigator under ""Model"" → ""Surfaces"" → ""Surface axis systems x, y, z"". All stresses with a ""+"" in the suffix represent the stresses at the top, ie the side of the positive local z-axis. In this specific case, this means that my represents the bending moment of the bracket in the direction of the global y-axis and must therefore have a value of 2 kNm/m as a result. The average in the diagram shown confirms this assumption with a value of 1.95 kNm/m (deviations can be reduced by using a finer FE mesh). The average of the shear flow is 100 kN/m and thus it corresponds to the applied load. The stress sigma-y,+ thus reflects the compressive stress of the flap at the top of the surface and tau-xy,+ corresponds to the shear stress in the joint on the same side."
"Why aren't loads automatically updated after importing with the ""Apply support reactions as loads"" function if you change the model?","With this type of load transfer, the load is created temporarily. This means, for example, that only surfaces that exist in the model can be selected.Subsequent changes to the model no longer have any effect on loads that have already been imported. They cannot be adjusted automatically. It is therefore recommended to first complete the modeling and only then import loads from another model."
I get the message that my license is already activated. What can I do?,"You use a soft lock that is tied to your computer's hardware. This binding is established by activating the softlock for the first time. Further activation is not possible. If you try to import the license on another PC or again on the original PC that was formatted or reset, you will get the message described.If you want to use the license on another PC, the license to be transferred. Instructions for this can be found in the attached document starting on page 2."
How are the reduced vibration coefficients taken into account when using DIN EN 1993-6? ,"The NCI to DIN EN 1993-6, Chap. 2.3.1 allows the reduction of the dynamic factors (vibration coefficients) for the values ≥ 1.1. Thus, the reduced bearing loads may be used for the design of the support or suspension structures.If the national annex ""DIN"" is selected in CRANEWAY and the dynamic factors are ≥ 1.1, this reduction is automatically taken into account. "
"When opening a file, the message ""The model '1' is not assigned to any project. Do you want to create a new project for this directory?"" appears. Can I disable this notification?","In the project manager, select the ""Edit → Program options"" menu.In the dialog, uncheck ""Notice when opening and closing a model if it is not linked to a file folder"". These settings will be used after restarting the program."
"How can the individual settings in the ""Result diagrams in the member"" window be saved?","The only settings that can be saved in the result history are the checkboxes shown on the left. If you have made a selection there, you can save it by right-clicking in the navigator. If you then open the result curve of another member, the display is identical."
Why isn't the slanted headstock option available?,The following must be observed so that the end plate of the column can be arranged at an angle: The ledgers on the left and right of the column must not have any vertical member eccentricity. The inclination of the ledgers on the left and right of the support must be identical.
I want to change the web thickness of a parametric profile. How do I get back to the input dialog with the profile parameters?,"To do this, click on the [Edit] button in the ""Edit cross-section"" dialog. The original dialog appears, in which the profile parameters can be adjusted."
"Instead of deleting the link to the files folder, I accidentally deleted the project in the project manager. Is my data lost now?","You can restore the individual files: In the project manager menu ""Edit"" you have access to the Dlubal recycle bin. There you get a list of the deleted files.In the ""Edit"" menu you can also make settings for the storage space and file folder of the Dlubal recycle bin."
Are elastic supports (nodal and line supports with elastic spring constants) and elastic surface supports considered in RF-/DYNAM Pro?,"Yes, all supports that contain a spring constant are taken into account in the add-on module RF-/DYNAM Pro. In detail, this means that the elastic mountings are taken into account in the following areas:Natural vibration determinationTime history method of time diagramsResponse spectrum method (""Forced vibrations"" and ""Equivalent loads"")The attached example clearly shows how the eigenmodes of a member change when an elastic nodal support is added."
"When calculating a wooden panel as an orthotropic surface, the error message appears that the Poisson's ratio must be within a certain interval. What to do?","In this case it is not sufficient to set the stiffness type to ""Orthotropic"". You must also specify an orthotropic material model for the material, otherwise the stiffness matrix is singularly defined."
I want to calculate the buckling lengths for a frame column in the frame plane using RSBUCK or RF-STABILITY. Which load case or which load combination do I have to apply?,"RSBUCK and RF-STABILITY carry out an eigenvalue analysis for the entire model with a specific normal force state. As a result, depending on the required number of eigenvalues, the critical load factors with the associated buckling figures and a buckling length around the strong and weak axis for each member for each mode shape are output. Since each load case usually has a different axial force state in the elements, there is a separate associated buckling length result for the frame column for each load situation . Since this result can be different for each analysis due to the different load situations, the longest buckling length of all calculated analyzes is assumed to be the same for all load situations for a verification - to be on the safe side."
Which stress-strain curve is used for the reinforced concrete design in CONCRETE or RF-CONCRETE Members?,"In CONCRETE and RF-CONCRETE Members, the parabola-rectangle diagram is used for the reinforced concrete design."
Is it possible to calculate insulating glass panes for control purposes without climate loads?,"In RF-GLASS, the climatic loads are shown in Table 1.6. Here, the ""Use"" check box can be deactivated for the individual climatic loads in order to carry out the calculation without climatic loads."
"For ribs, is the integration width the same as the effective width?","No, the integration width corresponds to the load input width. If required, the effective width can be adjusted in the design module. If the plate portion is in the pressure range, the effective width is equal to the integration width from the default setting."
Which Poisson's ratio should I enter for the material Orthotrop for cross laminated timber?,"The selection of Poisson's ratio is not clearly regulated. In the case of primarily plate-like stress, the transverse strain can be set to approximately zero. In the case of a large shear distortion or torsion, a higher transverse strain in the main load-bearing direction is recommended."
I can only undo one operation in my model. Can this be set somewhere?,"To set the size of the buffer memory for the undo function, open the Program Options dialog via the Options menu.On the ""Program "" the buffer memory for undo function is preset to 4096 kB. You can increase the value accordingly."
Can I subsequently edit an image printed in the printout report,"Yes. To do this, right-click on the image and select ""Edit...""This will bring up the main program.

However, these settings apply globally to all graphics."
How can I apply the wind load distribution to a cylinder according to EN 1991-4 Section 7.9?,"You can use the ""Free variable load"" load type for this. It makes it possible to define a load that acts around the circumference by specifying an axis of rotation. The circumference can be divided into any number of segments.Furthermore, this load can also be used to generate a load that varies over the height. In the model file provided, a load with both variables is applied as an example. "
"Despite reading the current authorization file, the program starts in demo mode.","The most common reason is missing user rights.Start RFEM or RSTAB by clicking the icon with the right mouse button. In the context menu select the option ""Run as administrator"". Then read in the authorization file again via the ""Help → Authorization"" menu."
"With a plastic calculation, I get stresses that exceed the yield point. Did I do something wrong?","You are working with a plastic material behavior in your file and have entered the yield point. Therefore, the stress in your model will not increase, because if the stress is exceeded, the material will start to plasticize.The stress limit on the yield point always refers to an entire finite element (surface element or volume element). For this reason, the stress in the plastic calculation must always be considered with the ""Constant in elements"" smoothing. This smoothing is used for surface elements in the project navigator - Show ""Results → Surfaces → Development of internal forces/stresses → Constant in elements"" is activated. For solid elements, the entry under ""Results → Solids → Development of internal forces/stresses → Constant in elements"" is closed find.In RF-STEEL Surfaces you also have the option to set the stresses to ""Constant in elements"". Click on [Details] and go to the ""Options"" tab.In this technical article explains all smoothing variants of surface results in more detail."
My softlock license is no longer available. What can I do?,"This can have various causes. Please send us the ""authorization.txt"" file, which you can create in RFEM/RSTAB via the ""Help → Authorization → Diagnosis"" menu. This is also possible in demo mode.If you reset your computer or formatted the hard disk without changing the partitions, please contact our hotline. You will then receive your license file with instructions on how to reactivate the softlock. "
Can I use the output bearing forces directly for further calculations? ,"The bearing forces that are output are characteristic values including reduced dynamic factors and can therefore be used directly for further calculations. There are three sorting options for the display in the result mask 2.3.With the first option, all determined support forces of the load combinations are output. In addition, load case 2 wind load is displayed so that the bearing forces can be calculated back to the individual components (crane, permanent load and wind).With the option Only max/min only the extreme values of the bearing forces for the corresponding directions are output, ie the characteristic bearing forces multiplied by the associated vibration coefficient for supports.With the Display option Only max/min extended The extreme values of the horizontal bearing forces (with components from crane and wind load) and the vertical bearing forces (with components from crane and permanent load) are shown. The partial safety factors and combination factors used for the respective design situation can be displayed very easily in window 1.5 Load Combinations. This makes it quickly clear whether the calculated results are characteristic values or design values."
Why can't I change concrete cover for different rebar directions independently?,The independent adjustment of the concrete cover for different reinforcement directions is only possible if no proof of serviceability is provided. Otherwise the concrete cover will be automatically adjusted depending on the diameter of the reinforcement.
"For a floor slab calculated in RFEM, I would like to display the resultant of the support forces on this line support in a single load case for an individual line support.The total resultant of all support forces in a load case can be displayed.

"I want to design an irregular structure for earthquakes. Does RFEM automatically carry out the so-called modal analysis (taking into account several vibration modes) on the spatial system, or do I have to make a special setting for this?","The equivalent loads are determined using the multimodal response spectrum method. In order to examine a system spatially, the masses must be activated in all directions so that natural frequencies and shapes can be determined on the spatial system. Equivalent loads are then determined on the basis of the eigenmodes.Which eigenmodes are taken into account should be decided on the basis of the effective modal mass factors. According to EN 1998-1, 90% of the structural mass has to be activated in order to achieve accurate results."
"I entered the system with ""z-axis up"". Directions are now rotated when defining upper and lower beams and when outputting the required reinforcement.","For surfaces, the bottom reinforcement is in the direction of the positive local surface z-axis, and the top reinforcement is in the direction of the negative local surface z-axis. The surface axes can be displayed in the project navigator - Show via ""Model"" → ""Surfaces"" → ""Surface axis systems x, y, z"" or the context menu of the surfaces. The position of the local z-axis of a surface can be changed using the ""Reverse local axis system"" context menu option.The lower reinforcement for members is on the member side in the direction of the positive local member axis-z, the upper reinforcement accordingly in the direction of the negative z-axis. The member axes can be displayed in the project navigator - Show via ""Model"" → ""Members"" → ""Member axis systems x, y, z"" or in the member context menu."
How can you calculate the deformation in the cracked state of the concrete usinga) the required minimum reinforcementb) the required calculated reinforcement?,"The two options at the bottom of the ""Serviceability"" tab in mask 1.1 control whether the designs are carried out using the analytical or non-linear method. a) For the non-linear calculation in the serviceability limit state, the existing longitudinal reinforcement must be specified. b) With the option ""Use required reinforcement for serviceability"" the serviceability limit state check is combined with the amount of reinforcement that is determined for the ultimate limit state. You can find more information in the manual for RF-CONCRETE surfaces."
"For bedding beams and piles, I don't quite understand the spring index. Are the characteristic values of the displacement, shear and torsion springs constrained moduli (MN/m²) or bedding moduli (MN/m³)?","The springs are calculated from the area-related coefficients. These are given in kN/m³ and describe how many kN/m² are needed to compress the soil 1.0 m.To define the springs for a width-limited bar, the coefficients be multiplied by the width. For a horizontal bar with the z-axis pointing down, this is the y-extent. This gives you a displacement spring in kN/m² related to the member. It indicates how many kN/m are necessary to compress the soil 1.0 m.The displacement springs always refer to the local member axes. Please do not use the constrained modulus for the determination, but the bedding numbers. These are specified in kN/m³.The shear springs represent a constant torsion spring over the length of the bar and are specified in kNm/rad and per m. Replacing rad with m/m gives kNm/(m/mxm), which can be simplified to kN."
How can you create standardized printout reports and store them as templates on other computers?,New templates can be defined using these printout report menus: - Settings/Printout report template/New - Settings/Printout report template/New from current report In the Printout report selection dialog then the content can be specified. Then a name for the new template must be specified. The printout report templates are saved in the file RSTABProtocolConfig.cfg or RFEMProtocolConfig.cfg. They can be found in the master data folder of RSTAB or RFEM: - C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\RSTAB 8.xx\General Data - C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\RFEM 5.xx\General Data Now copy the file and replace it on the target computers.

Can the results of the design modules also be displayed in multiple colors? The utilizations are only displayed in two colors for me.,"In the display navigator, you can set whether the ratios are to be displayed in two colors, with or without progression, or on the cross-sections."
I have defined ten load cases and want to add two load cases - after the third load case. Is that possible?,"Yes, that's possible without any problems. For this, use the menu ""Extras"" → ""Renumber"" → ""Move"".The numbering of the load cases can be changed in section Adjust load cases and load combinations. Here you can specify the numbers of the load cases that are to be moved to create a gap . The size of this gap is specified in the column Move no. by."
I can no longer select a member or node in the table to select it in the graphic. What have I changed?,"The [Synchronization of the selection] and [Show selected objects] buttons in the table window have probably been deactivated. Switch it on again. Then an object whose table row is marked is also highlighted in color in the graphic. Conversely, if an object is selected in the graphic, the relevant line is also shown in the table and highlighted in color.Objects that are clicked in the data navigator are also selected in the graphic."
So far I have been informed about new versions by newsletter. It would be desirable if updates were checked automatically at regular intervals.,"The program has the option of automatically checking for updates:Choose the menu ""Options → Program options"". In the Program tab of the dialog you can then specify whether and after how many days the program should search for updates (see Illus. 01).In the ""Help"" menu you can also start a search for updates manually (see Illus. 02)."
How can I display the course of results in a volume?,"It is possible to cut through the volume. In this way, the deformation and stress curves in the section surface can be displayed.Alternatively, you can also use the ""Clipping plane"" function to display the section surface through a solid."
What are the ways to merge solids?,"If several solid bodies border one another, then these are usually rigidly connected to one another. The contact conditions of the solids can be easily adapted to the respective circumstances by means of surface releases and so-called contact volumes.In the case of solid models, composite solids can also be created: Boolean operations can be used to combine two volumes, subtract them or create them as an intersection. "
"If an area is selected by clicking on it, the associated nodes and lines are unfortunately not included in the selection. Is there a way to include these?","Sometimes it is necessary, for example, to add the objects associated with an area, such as nodes and lines, to a selection in order to be able to edit parts of the structure. This is very easy to do using the following function: Menu ""Edit"" → ""Select"" → ""Objects that belong together"""
How can I put a cutting plane in the model to hide disturbing areas?,"You can define a virtual layer where only everything in front of or behind the layer is displayed. You can find this function in the ""Insert"" → ""Clipping layer"" menu. The clipping plane can be moved step by step or rotated."
What information is graphically displayed when you hover over an object?,"With the so-called ""pre-selection"", certain object information is displayed before you click on an object. What is meant here are not the tooltips, but graphic information. This information can be set in the Project Navigator - Show, e.g. For example, in the case of members, the member orientations, tensile sides or profile outlines."
"With the current standards, it is time-consuming to consider all possible load situations and to select the relevant situations for the verification. Is there a simple way to do this?","When creating a new model, a standard can be defined that specifies the rules for creating load and result combinations in RSTAB or RFEM. This allows the decisive situation to be recorded reliably and relatively easily."
How can I quickly show and hide the guides in my system?,"You can control the display of the auxiliary lines in the project navigator - Show. You can also specify whether only the model or only individual or all existing auxiliary lines should be displayed in the overall view of the model. If the auxiliary lines protrude far beyond the model, the overall view can be restricted to the model."
What program languages are possible for the Dlubal programs?,"The interfaces of the program families RFEM, RSTAB and RX-TIMBER are available in the following languages:GermanEnglishEnglish (USA) FrenchSpanishItalianPortuguese DutchRussian CzechPolishChineseUsing the Options> Program Options you can change the language in the ""Program"" tab of the Program Options dialog.All language packs are already included in the programs.The language setting in the printout report is independent of the language of the user interface.

You can change the language via the printout report menu Settings → Language.For the printout report it is also possible to create your own language using a translation table ."
What can I use the results bar for?,"The member type Result member is a virtual member without any stiffness, which can be freely arranged in the model and is used to integrate member, surface and volume internal forces and to output these as member section sizes. With its help, for example, the result evaluation of wall-like beams can be greatly simplified. By defining a cross-section for the result member, you can also use a Dimensioning in the additional modules such as e.g. B. RF-STEEL EC3, RF-TIMBER Pro or RF-CONCRETE Members. In the picture, the reinforcement of window and door lintels as well as a slab crack was determined as an example. "
Is it possible to design assembled timber cross-sections?,"In timber construction, beams are often assembled from several wooden parts. The individual parts are connected using glue, nails, screws, dowels or fitting bolts. In the case of a connection made of glue, this is to be assumed to be rigid. In the case of connections with pin-shaped fasteners, for example, the connection is flexible and the cross-section properties of the connected parts cannot be fully applied.In RFEM and RSTAB it is possible to determine the flexibility of the connection in the individual layers for assembled timber cross-sections take into account. This is done by entering the reduction coefficient gamma, which can be determined using the “gamma method”, for example according to DIN 1052:2008 (8.6.2) or according to EN 1995-1-1 (Annex B). This coefficient takes into account a reduction in the Steiner proportions of the cross-section parts, resulting in an effective flexural rigidity.It is also possible to assign different materials to the individual cross-sections. This is done using the ""Hybrid..."" option, whereby one of these materials is to be specified as the reference material for determining the ideal cross-section values."
"Since only a few cross-sections are usually used for daily work, it would be advantageous if only these could be displayed in the cross-section library. What is the option here?","With the ""Filter"" option in the cross-section library, it is possible to display only profiles of certain standards, cross-section shapes or cross-section types. Optionally, the material can also be selected in the same dialog.The most frequently used cross-sections can also be summarized in a favorites list. The dialog for creating preferred profiles is called up with the [Edit current favorites group] button."
"For a project, I have to color individual cross-sections in the rendering red, green or yellow. How do you have to proceed here if individual bars should have a different color than others in the rendering?","In RSTAB and RFEM, different colors are assigned to objects such as materials, member types or cross-sections, which enable a clear rendering display.The Colors in rendering to entry in the Show navigator contains several selection fields. The active field controls the color mapping for the objects in the rendering. By default, the material colors defined for each material are used."
Is there a way to make building systems easier?,"In RSTAB and RFEM it is possible to create line grids. Cartesian, oblique, spherical and cylindrical grids can be created and, of course, labeled and dimensioned. These make it easier to model surface, grid or grid models.The dialog for creating a new line grid is called up via the ""Insert"" ->> menu. ""line grid"". The ""Line grid"" dialog appears for defining the new grid.The settings for the line grid can be saved as a template and used again later."
Can you also calculate cable structures with RSTAB and RFEM?,"Yes. Ropes can only be subjected to tension. This allows cable chains to be calculated taking into account longitudinal and transverse forces. To do this, it is necessary to define the entire rope as a rope chain, which consists of several rope rods. Catenary lines can be generated quickly via the ""Tools → Generate model → Arc"" menu. The more precisely the initial shape of the chain line corresponds to the real rope chain, the more stable and faster the calculation can be.It is advisable to pretension the rope rods. This prevents compressive forces that would lead to failure. Also, ropes should only be used when the deformations account for a significant proportion of the changes in the internal forces, ie when large deformations can occur. In the case of simple straight guying, such as a canopy, tension rods are sufficient. When evaluating the deformation figure of cable rods, the scaling factor in the control panel should be set to ""1"" so that the tightening effects look realistic.The third-order theory, also known as the ""cable theory"" or ""theory of large deformations"", takes into account longitudinal and transverse forces in the analysis of the internal forces. The stiffness matrix is formed after each iteration step for the deformed system.Locally defined member loads are currently treated in such a way that the load direction is retained as on the undeformed system. All internal forces are transformed to the deformed member axis systems. Members of the ""cable"" type are always calculated according to the third-order theory. The others Members are treated according to the chosen calculation theory."
We exchanged our HASP-HL network dongle for a Sentinel network dongle. What changes does this involve?,"The following changes result from the new Sentinel network dongle:1) The software package for this dongle includes the driver, the License Manager and the Admin Control Center. You can download it from the following links:GUI Version (User Interface): http: //download.dlubal.com/?file=Sentinel_LDK_GUI_setup.zipCommand line version: http://download.dlubal.com/?file=Sentinel_LDK_cmd_line_setup.zipAfter unpacking, the software package can be downloaded via the command line with the command ""haspdinst.exe -i “ must be installed.2) The service for distributing the licenses on the server is no longer called “HASP Loader” but “Sentinel LDK License Manager” and now runs on port 1947 (previously on port 475). 3) The ""nethasp.ini"" file is no longer required if the client does not automatically find the server in the network. The new file is called ""hasplm.ini"" and can be created on the client via the Admin Control Center (ACC). You can reach the ACC via the following link: http://localhost:1947In category ""Configuration"", tab Access to Remote License Managers you can then enter the IP of the server and confirm with ""Submit"".The file "" hasplm.ini"" is saved in the following directory: C:\Programs (x86)\Common Files\Aladdin Shared\HASP\"
How can the shear deformation of a bar be taken into account?,"The consideration of the shear stiffness can be controlled in the ""Calculation parameters"" dialog. If the shear deformations are taken into account, there is an increase in deformation due to the shear forces. The influence of shear depends on the cross-sectional areas Ay and A z. These cross-section values can be viewed in the tables or cross-section entries and adjusted if necessary."
"I changed the printhead in the printout report. However, the old report header still appears in the ""Print immediately"" graphic printout. How can I change the print head?","You can define the company header for the graphic printout as follows:In the ""Graphic printout"" dialog, click on ""Print immediately"" and then on the [Edit report header] button. In the following dialog you can decide which company header should be used for the printout.Of course there is also the option of defining a new report header and setting this as the standard."
Are different stiffnesses possible for the x and y directions of a surface in RFEM?,"Yes. To do this, orthotropic properties can be defined either for the material or for the surface.Orthotropic material:Enter the moduli of elasticity of the material for the two surface directions (if the add-on module RF -MAT NL is not licensed, only the material models ""Isotropic linear elastic"" and ""Orthotropic elastic 2D/3D"" can be used). Then assign the material to the surface. Orthotropic surface:Define the stiffness type of the surface as ""Orthotropic"". Then you can set the local stiffness matrix coefficients according to different criteria. "
What is the easiest way to enter a scissors hinge in RSTAB and RFEM?,"In the global reference coordinate system, special joint types such as the scissors joint are available. Scissor hinges represent the connection of beam crossings in RSTAB and RFEM. Target In the example file, four members connect to a node, of which two members each should forward moments in their ""flow direction"". However, no moments may be transferred to the other pair of bars. Consequently, only axial and shear forces are completely transferred in the node. Solution A scissor hinge can be implemented in RSTAB or RFEM with a global hinge definition. The hinge is then assigned either to members 1 and 2 or to members 3 and 4. The other crossing continuous member is modeled rigid without a joint.There is also a short video tutorial on the subject of ""scissor joints"", which you can view using the link below."
"In the RF-/DYNAM Pro - Equivalent Loads module, you have the option of considering random torsional effects. Which calculation approach is behind the calculation? Which values are to be entered for the eccentricities eX and eY?","The random torsion is regulated in EN 1998-1, clause 4.3.2. The eccentricities are to be determined manually, in EN 1998-1 these are given as 5% of the building length. In other international seismic standards, the principle of random torsion is regulated analogously, but the determination of the eccentricities can deviate. For each equivalent load (at each FE node / internal node), a torsional moment is determined using the following formula: $\mathrm M\;=\;\left|{\mathrm F}_{\mathrm x}\;\ast\;{\mathrm e}_{\mathrm y}\right|\;+ \;\left|{\mathrm F}_{\mathrm y}\;\ast\;{\mathrm e}_{\mathrm x}\right|$ Then the exported load cases are duplicated Number output - with the torsional moment M rotating around the vertical axis once in the positive and once in the negative direction of rotation."
How can I change the line widths in RSTAB?,"The line thicknesses in RSTAB and RFEM can be changed in the display properties.These can be accessed via the pulldown menu ""Options"" → ""Display properties"" → ""Edit"".In the The line thickness of the individual member types and lines can then be defined in the ""Model data"" → ""Members"" or ""Lines"" tab.Note:If you have already made several changes, but would like to make them If you don't use it all the time, you can save it in the configuration manager and work with these settings if necessary.To do this, select the menu item ""Configuration manager"" → ""New configuration"" → ""Display properties"" and make the desired settings here a. You can work with these settings using the ""Set configuration current"" function."
"I have entered a steel connection in RFEM and now I want to put the results on paper. However, the line supports and the point supports are displayed larger than the structure.How can I adapt the support size to my structure?","An attempt is always made to automatically adjust the storage sizes according to the structure size.In some cases, however, it may be necessary or desirable to change the display size. You can access the display properties via the pull-down menu ""Options"" →""Display Properties"" → ""Edit"". The nodal and line support display properties are found under the generic term ""Model data"".The display properties window can also be opened by right-clicking on the object to be changed in the display and selecting the item ""Display properties"" in the context menu. This automatically opens the corresponding object's display property for editing."
"When calculating in RF-CONCRETE, I get the results split into directions 1, 2 and 3. What is the general definition of the reinforcement directions?","The position of the reinforcement is defined in RFEM as follows:1.) Directions 1, 2 and 3Directions 1, 2 and 3 for results from RF-CONCRETE surfaces are the reinforcement directions. The directions 1 and 2 correspond to the directions of the local axes x and y. Direction 1 corresponds to the local x-axis, direction 2 to the local y-axis (provided no rotation angle was defined for the reinforcement: n1 = x and n2 = y at phi1 = 0° and phi2 = 90°).An angle of rotation would then define axis 3.The angle is set in window 1.4 of RF-CONCRETE Surfaces in the Reinforcement arrangement tab.In the case of internal forces, the designations 1 and 2 are the main axis directions.2.) Up/down with reinforcement (global Z-axis down down)Since RFEM can also calculate and design three-dimensional structures, the designation for reinforcement layers must be based on the local surface axis systems.Top here means on the side of the surface that is opposite to the positive local z-axis direction. Accordingly, the lower layer is defined in the +z direction from the local coordinate system. To distinguish it from the global coordinate system (X,Y,Z), it is denoted by lower case letters.The x and y axes lie in the plane, the z axis is perpendicular to the plane. You can display the local axis system as follows:- Activate the Show navigator on the left side of the screen (all display properties can be set here in a tree structure)- Open the ""Model → Surfaces"" branch and activate the checkbox in front of the entry ""Surface axis systems x,y,z"""
How to change the graphical representation of member loads?,"Changes to the graphical representation can be made in the display properties.You can access this window via the pull-down menu Options → Display properties → Edit or by right-clicking in the workspace. p>Under the Loads → Line and Member Loads tab, you can now make the desired changes, e.g. B. change the distance or set the size of the load image."
How are the internal forces for a beam (rib) determined in RFEM?,"2D The member type ""rib"" is to be used for modeling downstands and upstands. First, the beam must be defined as a rectangular cross-section and ""rib"". The integration width is to be specified in the details dialog of the rib. A resulting T-shaped cross-section is formed from the rectangular beam and the integration width.In the case of 2D positions, there are no normal forces in the members and surfaces, only the internal forces Vz , MT and My or mx, my, mxy >, vx and vy.Therefore, a different calculation approach than in the 3D model is used for ribs: The T-beam (defined from bar cross-section and integration widths) is placed with its centroid in the surface axis.If the integration width is changed in 2D positions, the rigidity of the system also changes!3DHere too, the rectangular cross-section must be defined as a ""rib"" member type with its effective width. However, the internal modeling differs fundamentally: The eccentricity is calculated from half the plate thickness and half the member height.In the case of 3D positions, the rectangular cross-section defined as a rib is connected eccentrically (half the plate thickness + half the member height) to the surface . This defines the rigidity of the system. It does not change when changing the effective width; the deformation of the system remains the same, but not the internal forces.The normal forces of the beam are determined from the sum of the member normal forces and the surface normal forces integrated over the integration width.For determining the bending moments both the plate normal forces and the plate moments are integrated over the effective width. The sum of the integral of the area moments with the member moments result in a portion of the T-beam moment. In addition, there is the integral of the plate normal forces and the bar normal force, which are multiplied by the respective lever arm to the center of gravity of the T-beam.The result is a bending moment that relates to the T-shaped cross-section of the entire beam. The reinforced concrete design for the T-beam can now be carried out with the rib internal forces.In the Show navigator you can switch between the output of the rib and member sizes under ""Results → Ribs"".The advantage of the more complex 3D rib model is that the stiffness and internal forces can be recorded more precisely.If the integration width does not correspond to the effective width, this can be used for the design in the RF- BETON rods. "
"In the model, lines and nodes that lie in one plane are not integrated in the surface in the surface properties. Even when selecting the area and with ""Select → Objects that belong together"", only the border lines are selected, but not the lines that lie in the area.With the ""Select special"" command with ""Enter the plane using 3 Nodes"" the lines are displayed integrated in the surface, but not after the creation of the FE mesh. I have set the tolerances for model regeneration to a plausible level.","Objects such as lines and nodes are automatically integrated into a surface as soon as these objects have a static function (e.g. support, load reference). Objects that are not statically relevant, on the other hand, are not automatically integrated.The reason is as follows: The results are not smoothed on integrated lines, so that there is often a jump in the color gradient of the result values. This is also correct on statically relevant lines. However, some integrated lines are only construction lines, which are mainly imported when reading in DXF files.If you activate the ""Unused objects in integrate the areas"", all lines are integrated into the area."
How do you set the reference material for composite sections?,"If different materials are available, it is necessary to specify a reference material. The ideal cross-section characteristics and cross-section profiles are then determined, which are related to this reference material. The reference material can be specified in SHAPE-THIN and in DICKQ via the basic information of the cross-section."
"A question about the shear design with specified basic reinforcement: I am of the opinion that the design value of the shear force resistance VRd,c should be constant for the same slab thickness if I specify a basic reinforcement. However, this is not the case. Is there an explanation for this?","In RF-CONCRETE surfaces, it is always first checked whether the required reinforcement is sufficient to absorb the shear stress. In a calculation with the first option ""Approach of the required longitudinal reinforcement"", you can see that already the required reinforcement is sufficient for a large part of the area to ensure the shear resistance. For this reason, when determining VRd,c, the required reinforcement is used instead of the basic reinforcement.Here is a brief explanation of the options in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces 1.3 Longitudinal reinforcement:Option 1:It is checked whether the statically required longitudinal reinforcement is sufficient to avoid the shear reinforcement. If not, then the shear reinforcement is required.Option 2:If the statically required reinforcement is not sufficient, the larger value of the basic reinforcement and the statically required reinforcement is used. If this is sufficient, the value is defined as the statically required longitudinal reinforcement (since it is required to avoid shear reinforcement).In cases where neither the statically required longitudinal reinforcement nor the basic reinforcement is sufficient to cover the shear reinforcement, for the calculation of VRd,c only applies the required longitudinal reinforcement and calculates the additionally required shear reinforcement.Option 3:Asl is increased for the calculation of VRd,c until either the longitudinal reinforcement is sufficient or the maximum degree of reinforcement is reached.The result display is designed to show only the statically required reinforcement to spend For this reason, only the statically required reinforcement is used for VRd,c. When attempting to avoid shear reinforcement, the maximum value of the statically required and the basic reinforcement is used.In cases in which lateral force reinforcement is mathematically required, the amount of existing longitudinal reinforcement in the formulas no longer has any influence. It would therefore not make sense to also consider the basic reinforcement in VRd,c.The program's procedure can be easily understood in the design details."
What are the differences between the JOINTS Stahl - DSTV and STIRNPL modules?,"The difference between DSTV and STIRNPL is that DSTV compares existing internal forces with permissible values from the DSTV ring binder according to DIN EN 1993-1-8 and thus determines the required connection from the typified connections. STIRNPL, on the other hand, carries out a complete recalculation for the connection according to DIN 18800.The connections in STIRNPL can also protrude on both sides. Four bolt rows are also possible. DSTV not only includes rigid end plates, but also articulated end plate and angle connections. In STIRNPL, in addition to the rolled sections (I, IPE, HE -A, HE-B, HE-M) any simply symmetrical I-profiles with normal force (IS and IU-profiles). In contrast, the DSTV ring binder only contains values for the common rolled sections (IPE, HE-A, HE-B, HE-M). In addition, the values calculated there are only permissible for bending with shear force; the normal force is not taken into account in the DSTV ring binder.To e.g. For example, to verify end plates on HD profiles, you can use STIRNPL by replacing the HD profile with an IS profile. For this profile you can define the dimensions of the HD profile, which then has the same stiffness and can be verified in STIRNPL."
"Which units are given in the presentation of the results of the support reactions (kN or kN/m)? There is no reference to this in the graphic. In the event that the bearing reactions are specified in kN/m, for which distance does the value then apply?","You can see the units of the node and line supports in the max/min info. For the bearing forces z. For example, the unit kN/m and kNm/m for the bearing moments are used.The information about this is not preset in the graphic, since the results of the internal forces can also be displayed in the graphic at the same time. The output of the units can be activated in the project navigator - Show under ""Results"" and there in the sub-item ""Result values"". A value refers here to a distance of 1 m.A partial value is specified in each FE mesh node. A snapshot of the line support is displayed, so to speak."
The sign of a negative reaction force is not displayed in the result graphic. How can this be explained?,"In the result graph, the reaction forces are always shown as positive, with the arrow directions being adjusted accordingly.This is intentional to make it easier to see the effect of the reaction force. In the Project Navigator - Show you can activate the additional output of the sign under ""Results"" and there in the sub-item ""Support reactions""."
I accidentally minimized the project navigator. How can it be enlarged again so that it covers the full height again?,"The navigator can be treated like a toolbar: You can ""grab"" it in the title bar with the mouse and move it to the workspace. Double-clicking on the title bar or moving it to the edge docks it again at the edge of the window. While moving, icons are displayed that make it easier to dock at one of the four edges.If the navigator is undocked, you can change its size by ""dragging"" the edges."
How are cable structures calculated in RSTAB and RFEM according to Theory III. OK?,"For example, if you calculate a structure with beams, columns and cables, RSTAB / RFEM only considers the third order theory (cable theory) for the cable. Ropes can only absorb tension; they fail in the case of negative normal forces.The member type ""cable"" means that the calculation is carried out according to the third order theory and cable chains do not break off, as is the case with the ""tension rod to tension rod"" arrangement. the case would be. This is the main difference to the member type ""tension member"". Cables are therefore automatically calculated according to the third-order theory, taking into account longitudinal and transverse forces.Tension bars and cables each have a stiffness in the longitudinal direction, with cables also being assigned an ideal stiffness in the transverse direction. It is 1/200 of the stiffness in the longitudinal direction. This transverse stiffness is required in order to be able to calculate a rope chain.To correctly determine the sag lines of deformed ropes, ropes must be modeled using several connected rope rods (rope chain). If this subdivision is missing, the sag line is not determined. This leads to unusable results."
"For a bearing that can only transfer compressive forces, tensile forces are also displayed. How is that possible?","In a result combination of your model, alternatively acting (""or"") load cases are linked in such a way that they act positively and negatively. Negative factors in an EC can be problematic if the calculation is non-linear: the failure of springs, tension rods, etc. then acts in the ""wrong"" direction and delivers corresponding results.The EC results are taken from the existing ones Combined results: If a support has compressive forces in a load case, the minus sign in the combination criterion changes the size and applies it as a tensile force.Remedy: Define the load cases that should have a negative effect in the combination criterion as new load cases with negative load."
"Is your software only available for Windows? Or also for OS X to start it on a Mac, or for Linux?",RSTAB and RFEM are generally only available for Windows. We recommend running the Dlubal applications only on a PC with this operating system.
"When plotting graphics in the ""Filled"" display mode, is it possible to set the print quality even higher than ""Maximum (max 5000 x 5000 pixels)""?","Unfortunately no. In our experience, the quality of the printout depends on the printer driver. If you have problems, please try to find the solution there first.If the rendering is already displayed jaggedly in RSTAB or RFEM, this is due to the graphics card. The rendering is shown using the OpenGL functions. You can influence this via ""Options"" → ""Program Options"" in the ""Graphics"" tab. A different graphics card driver could also improve the display (e.g. download from www.treiber.de).Plotting processes very large amounts of data. This sometimes exceeds the limits of the operating systems. The plot output in the size ISO A0 with very good quality is therefore sometimes problematic. RFEM does not use its own drivers to control the plotter, but rather the drivers supplied with Windows. Tests have shown that these drivers are unstable and buggy. Therefore, the original drivers from the plotter manufacturer should be used. The plotter should also not be set as the default printer in Windows, but should only be selected when printing.Many plotter drivers offer the alternative of preparing the graphics in the plotter or in the computer. The processing in the plotter is faster, but since the plotter only has a very small working memory, parts of the image can be lost. This results in missing labels, lines, or fills. The plotter often also issues a corresponding message, e.g. B. HP ""Data Lost""."
RFEM automatically calculates all load combinations according to the second-order theory. Can this be turned off?,"To change the default calculation theory of the load cases and load combinations, open the ""Calculation parameters"" dialog. You can specify the calculation typeindividually in the tabs of the load cases and load combinations. You can find more information in RFEM or RSTAB -Manual."
"Is there a more elegant way than ""copy & paste"" to import the result data from the tables e.g. E.g. to Excel or to a text file?","If you want to export the result data from the tables to a text file, you can use the printout report function Export to RTF. It can be called up in the File menu.The rich text format is the most common, manufacturer-independent text format. It is also supported by MS Word. When exporting the data to RTF, all structured numeric values of the printout report are printed in an RTF file, which you can then e.g. B. can be further processed in Word.Alternatively, the export function can also be used to export parts of the tables to Excel."
Can the numerical values of the intervals of the isolines be freely defined (e.g. output of the isolines for the lower reinforcement as1 in steps of 5.0 cm2/m)?,"The intervals of the isolines can be controlled via the settings in the panel.By double-clicking on the color scale in the panel, the value and color range can be customized. It is possible to determine the intervals directly by entering a numerical value. Alternatively, the upper and lower extreme value, which is to be covered by the color gradient, can also be set here. By clicking on the [Fill in] button, the numerical values for the individual intermediate values of the color gradient are interpolated and filled in automatically.The user-defined value scale can be saved under a separate name using the [Save...] button.

"I would like to output the graphic (e.g. isolines for the lower reinforcement) without a colored display, but the isolines labeled with the numerical value on the printer.","The isolines are also printed in color when ""Texts and lines black"" is selected.This is because the ""Texts and lines black"" setting only refers to structure data. The isolines as results are output in color.So you should use the ""Grayscale"" option here. The results are also output in shades of gray.If there is e.g. If, for example, yellow isolines show very faint, light gray lines in the log, you can change this accordingly in the color panel. To do this, double-click the gradient in the panel. In the ""Edit value and color scales of the isolines"" dialog, you can now change the individual colors by double-clicking on the individual color again.You can save the changed color scale in this dialog or with the ""Standard"" button. revert back to the original history."
"With my L profile, there are no My and Mz moments when the bar is rotated by 45°. What is the cause?","In the case of asymmetrical cross-sections (angles, Z-profiles), the main axes are inclined. The angle α describes the position of the main axes u and v in relation to the standard axis system: This is the angle between the bar axis y and the 'strong' cross-section axis u. It is positively defined in a clockwise direction.Bending moments of an asymmetrical cross-section are output by default in relation to the main axes. The designations Mu and Mv therefore appear in the graphic and in the table. If the values of the moments are to be output in relation to the member axes y or z, the corresponding setting must be made in the results navigator. The internal forces My and Mz are then displayed in the graphic and in the table. The display of the main axes can be activated in the display navigator via the ""Member axis systems x,u,v"" entry."
Is there an option in RFEM to graphically copy multiple concentrated loads?,"Holding down the Ctrl key, select the nodes whose concentrated loads you want to copy.Now click on the [Move or Copy] button.

In the Detailed settings for moving/rotating/mirroring dialog, check the Copy load checkbox.If you now confirm with [OK], all are in advance selected concentrated loads around the corresponding vector."
Can I influence the size of the load values in RFEM?,"In RFEM, the magnitudes of the load values can be adjusted under the display properties. You can reach this z. B. via the pulldown menu ""Settings → Display properties → Edit"" or you click with the right mouse button on the load to be changed. Under the category Load can then be set for the respective load type, position, size and color etc."
I used the penetration method to create a wall opening in a circular-cylindrical wall surface.How can I now hide the auxiliary surfaces for creating a penetration?,"By creating an intersection, additional components are created in addition to the actual surfaces, which e.g. B. represent the intersecting tubes. After generating the penetration, all components are initially active. This can be seen in the Data navigator under the entry for the surfaces.Individual components can be deactivated afterwards. To do this, either click on the entry in the navigator or select the respective component in the model. This can be deactivated in the dialog for editing the component.Alternatively, it is possible to deactivate the component via the associated context menu (right-click on component) in the Data navigator."
Can I change the default colors of the materials in RFEM or RSTAB?I want to use this to adjust the color of the structure in the full model.,"In RFEM and RSTAB you have the option to save the color of the materials as user-defined. This changes the color of the full model.In order to change the color of a material, the Edit Material dialog must first be opened. There, by clicking on the [Edit material color and texture] button, the dialog with additional colors can be opened. If a different color is assigned to the material, all structural parts to which this material has been assigned are displayed in a different color in the rendering."
How can I graphically display the placement direction of the reinforcement in RF-CONCRETE?,"You have two options for displaying the reinforcement direction:1. Activate the ""Show reinforcement direction"" option in the Results navigator. In addition, the option ""For each FE element"" can be activated. This is of particular interest when the alignment of the FE axes is curved or arranged radially.2. When displaying using ""Values on surfaces"" and using ""Groups"", the result values are entered in the direction of the laying direction."

How do contact stresses σz affect curved surfaces?,"The contact stresses σz act on surfaces of revolution in the direction of the local z-axis of the surface. Each FE element has its own local coordinate system, which is related to the local coordinate system of the surface matches. If the z-axis of the surface points outwards, this is also the case for all FE elements - along the entire surface.The effective direction of curved surfaces can be checked in the graphic if the pointing Navigator the option ""FE mesh → On surfaces → FE axis systems x,y,z"" is activated."
Do the surface beds of the contact stresses σz refer to a global or a local coordinate system?,"The surface beds always refer to the local coordinate system of the surface.You can show the local coordinate systems via the context menu of a surface: Right-click on a surface and then select the ""Local axis systems"" option on/off""."
Is there a way to change the cover page after it has already been created once?,"The cover sheet of the printout report can be edited and changed via the context menu of the ""Cover sheet"" item in the navigator.To do this, right-click on ""Cover sheet"" and select ""Properties"" in the context menu entry "" off.

"In the RF-/LTB add-on module, I noticed that you can only select load cases and load combinations for the design. Why not result combinations too?","RF-/LTB requires clear internal forces over the member axis for the design. This condition exists due to various standard requirements, which regard the member element to be designed as a component and use result gradients across the member axis to determine the design parameters (normal force curves, bending moment curves, etc.).In order to meet this requirement, the project clear design cases for the calculation kernel for the internal forces to be designed. Representative of such unique design cases are load cases and load combinations. Since result combinations are mostly used for the enveloping results, they are blocked in RF-/BGDK."
How is the change in the moment of inertia Iy taken into account for variable cross-sections (haunches)?,"RFEM and RSTAB interpolate the changing stiffnesses along the member according to high-order polynomials. The determination of the cross-section values is controlled by the haunch shape. If different cross-sections are defined for the start and end of a member, you can select a ""linear"" or ""square"" haunch approach. This allows the haunch geometry to be mapped for determining the interpolated cross-section values.In most cases, the haunch is linear, ie the member tapers or widens evenly over the height from the start cross-section to the end cross-section. However, if there is a change in profile width and profile height, the quadratic approach for interpolating the cross-section values is recommended.For exact results, however, it can also make sense to manually divide the haunch bar and introduce additional cross-sections.The member division for haunch and bedding members, which is managed in the calculation parameters, also has an influence on the calculation of the haunch members."
Can material libraries be created on a server so that every user has access?,"Yes. There are two databases:Standard material libraryUser material library for user-defined materialsThe path information for the libraries is saved in RFEM and RSTAB controlled under the Program Options. This dialog can be called up via the ""Options → Program options"" menu. You can find the paths in the ""Data directories"" dialog tab.Different databases are available for selection in the ""Category"" drop-down list. The paths can be read and adjusted in the field below. This way you can copy the library files to the server and set the paths on each machine."
How can the nodes of the inclined top flange of a generated 2D truss be moved into the member axis without having to calculate the x and z vectors beforehand?,"The nodes of the inclined top chord can be moved in the member axis using the ""Project"" command from the ""Edit"" pull-down menu.To do this, the node must first be selected and then the command called. In the window that appears, the nodes can then be moved using a factor and the specification of the direction.If the factor is difficult to determine, the following procedure is also very suitable:Should For example, if the nodes are moved in the X direction, simply change the node coordinates to the desired new coordinates. As a result, the belt is no longer correctly inclined, but this can be easily corrected with the ""Project"" command (""Edit"" pull-down menu).Before calling up the command, select the corresponding node again and then enter in the Provide the projection direction and the line of sight in the ""2D Project"" window.According to your system description, you must use Z as the direction of projection and you define the line of sight using 2 points that describe the inclination of the belt. After confirming with [OK], the belt has the correct inclination again and the knots are in the right place."
Does RFEM also offer the possibility to calculate membrane structures?,"In RFEM it is possible to define a surface of the type ""Membrane"" (see picture). The calculation is then automatically carried out according to Theory III. order.The add-on module RF-FORMFINDUNG is ideal for modeling membrane structures. "
"In the case of a single-span beam with uniform load (M=q*l2/8), the moment graphic is not displayed as a parabola. The table result values are only correct at the maximum, but not at the other points.","The problem with the internal forces graph is due to the member divisions. There are several divisions to consider in RSTAB. 1. Member divisions for result tables The member divisions for result values can be created via ""Insert → Model data → ""Member divisions"". This division ensures that, for example, in RSTAB table 4.1 the internal forces of the members can also be output at intermediate points.The graphical output remains unaffected. 2 > The divisions for the graphical result curve and the determination of extreme values can be viewed and influenced in the calculation parameters (""Calculation"" pull-down menu). If you set the value for ""Result curves"" there to a larger value, the internal force graphic will also be displayed more finely. This division in the calculation parameters is global It is based on the longest member. Shorter members therefore do not have the same number of divisions, but similarly sized sections. To improve the graphics, it is therefore advisable to use a finer division."
calculated a box girder. Which surface results or surface stresses can I use to evaluate the buckling behavior of the web plates?,"Only based on the surface results or surface tensions, no statement can be made about the buckling behavior of the box girder. The stability behavior can be examined with the RF-STABIL module. It determines the buckling figures and critical load factors, which enable a statement to be made about the buckling behavior.But this does not yet lead to a buckling analysis. To do this, the buckling figure would have to be transferred to the model so that it can be calculated according to the second order theory on the imperfect system. A stress analysis with the RF-STEEL module could then be used to carry out a buckling analysis.The Transferring the dent figure is facilitated with the RF-IMP module. There, the equivalent geometry can be generated based on the stability figur, so that the buckling can be verified with a second-order stress analysis on the pre-deformed system with RF-STEEL.The procedure in RFEM could look like this:Modeling of the entire cross-section as a 3D modelApplication of the loadsCalculation of the buckling figures with RF-STABILITYGeneration of an equivalent model with RF-IMPCalculation of the second order load combinations based on the equivalent modelStress analysis with RF-STEEL Alternatively, you can use the FE-BUCKING module to examine the buckling behavior.It There are already some very interesting specialist articles on this topic on our website."
"am modeling a curved disc, in which circular holes are to be drilled in some places. In order to create the holes in RFEM, I first have to draw a circle in the disk plane so that I can then use it to create an opening. How do I draw a circle in a curved surface?","In order to be able to define openings or recesses in surfaces, you need the edge lines of the opening. In the case of flat surfaces, these can be created without any problems.However, this is not so easy with curved surfaces, so that the penetrations can be used here. To do this, you must first create an object that penetrates the surface at the desired location for the opening. In this case it is a tube.Then select the surfaces at the same time and then select the ""Create penetration"" command from the context menu. This will create the penetration curves.You can access the ""Component"" tab from the ""Edit Component"" menu and enable or disable the created surface parts there. To create the opening, uncheck all active components that are not needed."
"Can a haunch bar be split in such a way that the interpolated cross section is automatically determined at the split point? Can the cross-section of a haunched set of bars also be changed by changing the cross-section height of one bar (start, middle or end of the set of bars) and then automatically determining the new cross-section heights for the other bars?","If a haunched member is divided by nodes, the interpolated intermediate cross-sections are created automatically.For members that have already been divided or for sets of members, the division must first be undone in order to be able to use this feature. A common solution is therefore the following:First, all members with loads are copied and the intermediate nodes are deleted, merging the lines. Then the cross section is adjusted and the original is deleted. Now the copy can be moved to the original location. If the automatic division of members at nodes is deactivated, it still has to be done manually. The procedure is shown in the attached video."
"For a steel frame, I manually created 20 load combinations with partial safety factors. However, the deformations should be determined without coefficients. I do this as follows:I copy each LK individually (several LKs cannot be copied at the same time).In each LK, I set the factors to 1.0. Isn't there a more elegant way?","Several load combinations can already be copied at the same time without any problems. The easiest way to do this is in Table 2.5. If the respective lines are copied with Ctrl + C, they can be read in again at another point with Ctrl + V.The corresponding factors can then be easily and quickly e.g. For example, the ""Set"" function can be used to change the value to 1x (see video).Alternatively, the combinations can also be generated automatically in the General information dialog. In addition to the ultimate limit state, various design situations for the serviceability limit state are available as combination rules: 'Characteristic', 'Frequent' or 'Quasi-permanent'. This means that the partial safety factors are automatically applied correctly."
I imported an stp file into RSTAB. Now the axis-related cross-section values of the L and Z profiles are reversed.How can I avoid this?,"In the detailed settings for the DSTV interface, you can specify that profiles of type L and Z are mirrored: ""File > Import"" menu, DSTV interface (*.stp) tab Remove the tick there."
"I would like to see maximum and minimum reaction forces in my representation for a result combination. However, I only get maximum powers displayed. ","The fact that only the maximum support reactions are displayed in the EK is due to the ticked option ""Absolute extreme value for result combination"" in the project navigator - results for the support reactions.If you remove this tick, then at selection of the minimum values, the minimum bearing reactions are also displayed."
Can I delete the results of models without opening the files? The files are in different directories.,"The project manager offers the possibility to delete results from RFEM and RSTAB files: Right-click on the file. In the context menu, select the entry ""Delete results"". Of course, this option only exists if the folders are integrated as projects in the project manager."
I would be interested to know whether it is possible in the RSTAB printout report to specify only the internal forces from the start and end nodes in the Result Table 4.1 Members - Internal Forces . The maximum or minimum internal forces of the member ends are completely sufficient for an output that is intended to be used to construct connections.,"If only the internal forces of the start and end nodes are to be output in the printout report for the results table Members - internal forces, this can be done via the selection in the printout report.Call via the menu item ""Edit"" the ""Selection"". Here you can z. For example, select the ""LC/LC results"" tab and call up the Details for the member-related internal forces. There you can specify that only the ""node values"" should be displayed. In the preview, only the lines of the start and end nodes are then displayed for the load case and load combination results.The same can be set for result combinations in the EK Results tab .Basically, the output depends on the settings in RSTAB or RFEM.An output at intermediate points in the members depends on the definition of a member division. If you edit e.g. B. a member, you can define a ""member division"" in the window that appears. Internal forces are then also output at these points.Please note, however, that you have ticked the ""All values"" box under ""Results"" → ""Members"" in the Show navigator , as this is disabled by default. You can also export the data to an RTF file and then further simplify the data. The RTF export is available in the printout report via the File menu item."
"How can the wind load be applied to the surface according to an angle function (e.g. grain silo, curved wall, etc.)?","For entering the wind load on the rotational shell, RFEM offers the option of a linearly variable load curve.To make the input easier, it is advantageous if the shell is made up of several sections. Eighth circle sections would be well suited for this. The load can then be defined in the local z-direction with a linear load curve.Depending on the required accuracy, the sections can of course also be reduced."
"When I open a model, a yellow marker arrow appears on a support. It disappears as soon as I click on the arrow or in the working window.What does this arrow mean?","A yellow arrow in the graphic indicates the point that is selected in the results table. This can be a support node - as in your case - or a grid point that is selected in the results table in RFEM.Display and click on the Tables menu item e.g. B. in the result table 4.1 in a row, a yellow arrow is displayed for this node in the graphic, so that this point in the graphic can be found more quickly.After opening, the arrow therefore appears, because when the file was last closed, a row was selected in the result tables and that setting was saved."
Is it possible to access a license via the Internet? The license manager (network dongle) is installed on a server with a public IP address or FQDN.,"Have your administrator check whether you are authorized to dial into the server via VPN.Once the VPN connection has been established, access to the full version of RFEM, RSTAB, SHAPE-THIN etc. work. The authorization file for the network dongle must of course be used for this.Notes on the network dongle can be found in the following document: Installation-Sentinel.pdf "
"In SHAPE-THIN, I want to connect a remote element to the rest of the cross-section using a null element. Graphically, this is possible without any problems. In the calculation, however, SHAPE-THIN then requires a thickness t* to be specified for the shear calculation.","In chapter 7.2.1 of the SHAPE-THIN manual you will find the formulas for shear areas and Bredt's torsional moment of inertia. There the element thickness t* is in the denominator, so division by zero would be a problem. In the case of ""free"" zero elements, a user-defined substitute thickness must therefore be specified, e.g. E.g. the thickness of one of the adjacent elements.Select the null element and in the ""Edit Element"" dialog check ""Effective Thickness for Shear Transfer"". Then the input field t* becomes accessible. Then the calculation is possible."
Can effective length factors ß or kcr for sets of members also be determined in RSBUCK?,"RSBUCK does not output any effective length coefficients of sets of members. Here you can only start from the results of the individual members. You can regard the member for which the smallest critical buckling load Ncr is output as decisive for the set of members. It can also be helpful to consider the axial forces in the individual members. If they are the same over the set of members with an unchanged cross-section, the effective length coefficients are also the same. This value can then also be used for the set of members."
"If you want to increase the thickness of the slab in a foundation in the FOUNDATION Pro module, the side length also changes automatically.How can you stop this behavior?","If the dimensions for the side lengths also change after an increase in the plate thickness, this is due to the setting that the punching cone should lie within the foundation plate. This behavior can be set using the ""Details"" button in the Input masks adjustable. Here you will find the entry ""Punching cone within the foundation plate"".In order to be able to freely define the geometry, uncheck this option."
"In RF-STABILITY, negative critical load factors are sometimes output. How are these to be rated?","In the case of negative eigenvalues, there is no stability failure because of the tensile forces in the model. No statement can be made about the buckling and buckling behavior to be expected.If negative critical load factors are shown, the number of stability figures to be determined should be increased. If the number is too small, it is not possible to hide the negative eigenvalues to show only the positive, realistic results.Alternatively, the ICG eigenvalue solver method can be used to exclude negative bifurcation load factors."
Is it possible to insert a graphic from a clipboard in the printout report? ,"In order to insert a picture that is not an RFEM or RSTAB graphic, the graphic file must first be opened and copied to the clipboard with [Ctrl]+[C].The graphic in the The clipboard is then inserted into the printout report via the Insert → Graphic from clipboard menu.The chapter name for the new graphic must be specified beforehand.

"A steel building should have several floors and be reinforced with bracing on all levels.However, the 1st floor should be made of reinforced concrete. Consequently, the horizontal bracing will work through this reinforced concrete slab. How can I model this shear-resistant reinforced concrete slab in RSTAB?","If you want to model stiffening panes in your system, you can do this using members of the Rigid member and Coupling types. To simulate a stiffening slab, you can enter a diagonal member (or two) that simulates the surface.If two nodes are connected by a link, this means that the internal forces go directly from node to nodes are transferred. There are no ""losses"" because the members have an infinitely high rigidity.You can add any joints to the ""Rigid member"" type. There are four variants of the couplings, with and without joints.More precise modeling can be done with the FE program RFEM possible because the truss model only approximates the disk and plate effects. For example, you could create the framework model in RSTAB and then open it as a copy in RFEM and add the surface elements."
"What does the calculation parameter method ""Failing bars are removed one by one in the respective iterations"" mean?","First, an iteration step is calculated with all members. Before the next iteration step, it is examined which members cannot absorb the determined forces due to their definition, e.g. B. Tension bars with negative normal forces. The tension bar with the greatest compressive force is then removed from the stiffness matrix. This is the next iteration step.Then the member definitions are compared again with the determined forces. For the next iteration step, the most heavily loaded tension member is removed from the stiffness matrix again. This process continues until there are no more internal forces that it cannot absorb.With this method, the system usually shows better convergence behavior because redistribution effects become effective. However, this variant requires more time because a larger number of iterations have to be run through. In addition, it must be ensured that a sufficient number of possible iterations is provided. It is also conceivable that the tension rod that failed at the beginning is reinserted in a higher iteration step if it receives tensile forces again due to rearrangements."
"I calculated a second-order frame. The examiner says the frame is not stable because the flexural buckling verification is not fulfilled.What do you have to consider when verifying according to the second-order theory? Do I have to calculate the system three-dimensionally, even though it is a plane frame?Which modules do I need for a lateral-torsional buckling analysis when calculating according to the second-order theory?","If the internal forces were calculated according to the second-order theory, no flexural buckling analysis using the equivalent member method is required for the strong axis. But: when determining the internal forces, inclinations and precambers of the members must be taken into account in the load combinations EN 1993-1-1 requires that the influences of structural deformations, geometric imperfections, slippage in connections and, if applicable, effective widths from local buckling must be taken into account. Therefore, create imperfection load cases, which you then take into account in the load combinations without partial safety and combination factors.In practice, the internal forces in the frame plane are primarily calculated with imperfections. Buckling out of the plane of the frame and lateral-torsional buckling are often still carried out using the equivalent member method - but with the internal forces already available according to the second-order theory.The general method for stability analyzes was also introduced in EN 1993-1-1. First of all, the ideal critical load of the system to be measured is determined, taking into account imperfections from the main supporting plane. The system leanness and the reduction factor can then be calculated from this. Here, too, the internal forces in the frame plane should first be calculated according to the second-order theory, in order to then separately verify buckling and lateral-torsional buckling using the general method. A spatial calculation is therefore not absolutely necessary.Note that both the standards and the ledger can fail on lateral buckling and lateral-torsional buckling. In EN 1993-1-1 there is only one stability analysis that includes all failure modes.You can perform the stability analysis and the cross-section analysis with the add-on module RF-/STEEL EC3. You have the choice between the equivalent member method and the general method. For an exact design according to the second order bending torsion theory with consideration of the warping, the supplement RF-/STEEL Warping Torsion or the add-on module RF-/ FE-BGDK recommended."
"According to which criteria is the position of the ""upper"" and ""lower"" reinforcement determined?","If the Global Z axis is pointing down, then this definition applies:""Bottom"" is on that side of the surface from which the positive local z surface axis points out , ""above"" corresponds to that in the direction of the negative local z-axis. (Note: notation of the global axis Z and the local surface axis z.)Shows the Global Z axis up, this definition is reversed:The bottom reinforcement is on the negative local surface z-axis side, the top reinforcement is on the positive surface z-axis side accordingly. The local surface axes can be displayed in the Show navigator via Model > Areas > Surface axis systems x,y,z.The z-axis of a surface can be changed quickly: right-click on the surface. Then select the Invert local axis system entry in the context menu. With this you can z. For example, to standardize the reinforcement layers of walls.It is advisable to align the global Z-axis downwards when creating the model. This ensures that the local z-axes for surfaces in the XY plane automatically point downwards and the lower reinforcements are therefore also on the underside of the surfaces."
I would now like to make the roof pitch 5 degrees steeper for an existing system. I found two functions in the Edit menu that I could use: Rotate and Bevel.What's the difference between the functions and how can I get there faster?,"The ""Bevel"" function will get you there faster. This is because the nodes of the rods are shifted according to the desired angle of rotation. The length of the bars changes.To do this, select the nodes of the left roof slope and call up the ""Slant"" function. Enter the desired angle and the axis around which you want to rotate. Then select another point on the ground plane around which to rotate. In this example, an endpoint of the stems. When skewing, the nodes of the members are moved and thus the loads on the members and nodes as well. On the other side of the roof you do the same thing, except that you don't select the ridge nodes and you change the sign of the direction of rotation.If you were to use the ""Rotate"" function for the problem, the The lengths of the members remain the same and the nodes of the upper and lower chords no longer have the same xy coordinates. The nodes of the top chord would shift slightly in the x-direction."
"What does the ""positive"" and ""negative"" surface side mean?","The ""+"" and the ""-"" in the design internal forces and in the stresses indicate the side of the surface: The positive side ""+"" is the side from which the local z-axis looks out.The design internal force my,D+ is, for example, the decisive bending moment for the reinforcement on the positive surface side."
"In RFEM/RSTAB it is possible to multiply the loading of a load case by a factor. Is this load case factor always taken into account, i.e. also in load combinations? Or is the factor only used in the single load cases?",The load case factor is always taken into account in the calculation - also in load and result combinations.The same applies to the factor of load combinations.
How are the results of the contact stress (bottom stress) from surface bedding or bar bedding displayed on the model?,"The results of the base stresses are referred to as ""contact stresses"" in RFEM and are displayed on the model using the Results navigator. You can use the Select Contact voltages for display. For surfaces z. For example, sigma-z represents the stress in the transition to the bedding. The output is in tabular form in the results masks 4.21 Surface and contact stresses and 4.7 Beams - Contact Forces. For surfaces, it is also possible to output the total sum of contact stresses for the individual surfaces using Table 4.21Surfaces - Contact Stresses . These tables are also reproduced in the printout report."
How does RFEM apply the distributed load if the loaded surface has an opening?,"If there are openings in surfaces, the surfaces in the opening areas are not loaded. The loads in the area of the openings are therefore subtracted.The picture shows a rectangular area with a rectangular opening. In the results table 4.0, the sum of the load is displayed correctly."
What happens in Sturm's control?,"The so-called Sturm check checks whether all eigenvalues have been found within a certain interval. The diagonal matrix from the Gauss decomposition is used, the number of negative diagonal elements of which corresponds to the number of eigenvalues below the respective interval limit. The Sturm test is therefore used for the interval limits under consideration and the difference is calculated from them ."
"In the results of a result combination, I noticed that many extreme points are output with zero values, although there should be results there. Why is that?","The cause of these zero values lies in the superposition type in the combination criterion: If you evaluate several load cases or combinations in one EK and define the load cases or combinations as ""variable"", then at points with the same sign for the maximum or Minimum value zero output. Due to the variable (""possible"") superimposition, it is also possible that no load case or no combination is effective. Zero is smaller than the smallest maximum value or larger than the largest minimum value.One solution would be to define the load cases or combinations contained in the EC as ""permanent"", e.g. E.g.: EK1 = LK1/permanent or LK2/permanent or LK3/permanent or LK4/permanent The load cases or combinations are then compared as permanently acting. In this way you get extreme values not equal to zero even in the range of the same sign."
"I would like to print a specific page from the printout report. However, the print is for a different page.What could be the reason and how can I fix the problem?","A difference between the printout report and the paper printout can be caused by a preceding cover sheet, as this is not numbered.If this is not the case, the following reason may be possible: The printout report is always written with the printer driver defined as the standard. It should therefore also be printed with this standard printer. A solution could be found by setting the ""paper printer"" as the default or by installing a new printer driver and making this the default printer.For driver updates, see e.g. B. on www.treiber.de."
How can concentrated loads be applied to a curved surface?,"Concentrated loads can be defined on curved surfaces as follows:Construct a line through the curved surface that intersects the surface where the concentrated load is to be applied.In the ""Extras"" menu, select the ""Connect lines/rods"" function.Use the mouse to draw a rectangle in the graphic in the area where the line intersects the surface . Points are created on the surface.The points now lie exactly on the surface. However, they are not yet connected to the surface. This happens automatically on flat surfaces. In the case of curved surfaces, the points must be integrated manually. To do this, double-click on the area in which the points are to be integrated. Select the ""Integrated"" tab and add the numbers of the points, e.g. B. with [Pick].All points and lines that are no longer required can be deleted.Now the integrated points can be loaded with concentrated loads."
Does RFEM create a backup file while working? Where is this located?,"RFEM/RSTAB contains an automatic data backup. It is organized in the working directory of the program. The current models are created there as a subfolder of the program version. These contain all files that are created during input and calculation, including the backup file Position.bak.The working directory is set during installation. You can read the storage location via the ""Options → Program options"" pull-down menu in the ""Data directories"" tab if you set the Working directory category. Copy the Position.bak file to another folder and then rename it to ""Model.rf5"" or ""Model.rs8"". This is how you can open the file with RFEM or RSTAB.The Position.bak file is automatically deleted when you exit the program correctly. If the program crashes, this file still exists. You can restore them as described. After a crash, when you open RFEM/RSTAB, a message appears informing you whether the saved file (position.bak) should be opened again. Confirm with [Yes] to load the automatic backup file.Warning: The automatic backup file will be overwritten as soon as work is continued on other models or the old model (e.g. from yesterday day) is open for too long.You can adjust the backup interval for automatic saving via the ""Options → Program options"" menu in the ""Program"" tab. "
Loaded bars have been removed from one system. A calculation attempt is then aborted with the error message that the member does not exist. Is it possible to quickly delete the unnecessary loads in RSTAB/RFEM?,"If elements such as nodes, lines, members and volumes in the graphic are deleted after selecting them with the left mouse button, all associated loads in all load cases are usually also deleted.If these elements are deleted However, the associated loads remain in the tables, as they may still be required.If these loads that are no longer assigned should also be deleted, this can be done quickly in RSTAB/RFEM with the ""Extras → Delete loads → Unused loads"". Using this function, all loads are removed from all load cases whose model data has been deleted (does not exist ). The model can then be calculated again."
"In the course of the internal forces of the shear force, there is a jump just before the support, although no external force is acting there. How can this be explained?","The shear force internal forces change just before the support, since imperfections are taken into account at these points. Imperfections from pre-rotation and/or pre-curvature are applied as equivalent loads on the members. This equivalent load creates additional moments and shear forces. The moments also generate support moments that result from the misalignment.However, the shear forces must not generate any support forces, otherwise the system is no longer in equilibrium.This is the one in the adjacent images effect shown. A misalignment is applied in LC2.In the results of the load combination, you can see the resulting shear force from the equivalent load N * φ0: 10 * 1/282 = 0.035 kN. However, this transverse force does not represent an effect; it is not taken into account as a support force. The point shear force that occurs is therefore due to the equivalent load from the imperfection. Due to the misalignment, only a support moment arises. A horizontal bearing force cannot arise for reasons of balance (total load = sum of bearing forces). If the system is converted into a straight member with equivalent imperfection, it behaves the same way."
"We want to reinforce the base plate of a round container radially or tangentially.Is there a possibility that not an orthogonal reinforcement is calculated, but a radial or tangential reinforcement?","To display the results as radial reinforcement, the axes of the FE elements must be aligned. To do this, it is sufficient to align the axis system of the surface to a point (here the center of the circle). To do this, double-click on the surface to be processed and then switch to the ""Axes"" tab. Here you have various options for aligning the axes. Select ""Align axis x to point"" and use the graphical selection function to select the center point of the circular area. After recalculating the results in RF-CONCRETE Surfaces, the reinforcement is output radially and tangentially."
I'm having trouble entering free rectangular loads on inclined surfaces. Do other coordinate systems have to be selected for this?,"You don't necessarily have to choose a different coordinate system for the loads. If necessary, the loads should be applied in the local z-direction if they are to act perpendicularly on the surface.Please note the load projection planes when entering the loads. A straight line perpendicular to the load projection plane is ""constructed"" from the point entered in the Load Position section. If this line intersects an area that is listed in the ""At Area No."" is included, then the load is applied at the intersection. This makes it very easy to place similar loads on many surfaces.The areas where the gray dash-dot lines penetrate the surfaces are the limits of the surface load. The surface load is also displayed in this way if it acts perpendicularly on the surface.Of course, a separate coordinate system can be helpful when entering the coordinates graphically."
"A simple, rigid frame results in very large deformations. Why is that?","A very large value was manually entered for the cross-sectional area A. Extremely high values can lead to numerical problems when solving the system of equations.Check the results with smaller values. Also check whether the sums of the load and bearing forces match.Another tip:The automatic self-weight calculation is based on the density of the material and the area A. In your example, this results in very large loads. You canchange the value A,deactivate the self-weight in the general data of the load case orthe material density set to zero."
building is calculated level by floor. Is it possible in RFEM to insert the support forces of a calculated model into a new model as loads?,"Support loads from other RFEM models can be imported into the current load case as nodal and line support forces. However, bearing forces resulting from surface bedding and horizontal bearing loads cannot be accepted. The function that enables load transfer is located under the menu item ""Extras"" → ""Transfer bearing forces as load"". The model from which the loads are to be transferred must then be specified in a dialog. Furthermore, the LF, LK or EK number and the surfaces, nodes and lines whose bearing forces are relevant must be specified. It should be noted that the other model must have been calculated. Loads cannot be imported into a 2D plate from 3D models. Only loads in the Z direction are accepted."
Is it possible with RFEM or RSTAB to use the stiffness factor method?,"A modification of the bedding number method is used. A relation to the constrained modulus ES is not possible.A multi-parametric subgrade model is implemented in RFEM. This allows realistic settlement calculations to be carried out.One problem, however, is finding exact values for the parameters Cu,z, Cv,xz and C v,yz to find. The add-on module RF-SOILIN supports you here: From the loads and the data of the subsoil report (stiffness coefficient or modulus of elasticity and Poisson's ratio, specific weights, layer thicknesses) the bedding parameters are calculated for each individual finite element using a non-linear method. These parameters are load-dependent and in turn influence the behavior of the structure. The result of this iterative process is realistic settlements and internal forces in the structure."
A common imperfection should be used for several members arranged in a row. Why can't I do this? ,"The reason that no continuous misalignment can be applied is mostly because the rods differ in their alignment. However, the imperfections are based on the directions of the local member axes.You can see this clearly if you show the local member axis systems in the project navigator.The problem with The different orientation of the local z-axis is due to the general location of the bars. You can do this e.g. B. in table 1.7 (RFEM 1.17) in the column ""N"". If a member is crooked in space, the position of the local y and z axes is first automatically determined by RSTAB/RFEM. The z-axis lies in space in such a way that the Z-part of the directional arrow in relation to the global coordinate system always points in the positive global Z-direction. The y-axis then results according to the Right-hand rule.The crooked position of the rod can usually be traced back to an inaccuracy in the node. This is also the case in the attached example, as can be seen from the Y coordinate of node 1 (0.002 m instead of 0.000 m).It is also possible to increase the tolerance for considering a bar as vertical change. This setting can be made under ""Extras"" → ""Regenerate model""."
"In the representation of the line support forces, the distance between the arrows is very small. How can this be changed?","The distance between the arrows depends on the FE mesh. It cannot be changed via the display properties.The calculation provides a result value in each FE mesh node, so that each FE node also contains a value for the line support and thus also a support arrow. You can only change the distance between the arrows via the desired length of the FE elements. This is possible via the Calculation → FE Mesh Settings pull-down menu."
Why are the contact stresses of elastically bedded members given in [kN/m]?,"The ""contact stresses"" are output as contact forces in the member results. They refer (like a line load) to a rod length of 1 meter. The unit of length [kN/m] describes the force that is applied to a bar that is 1 meter wide.To get the contact stresses of a foundation with a width other than 1 m, divide the contact force by the foundation width. This gives you the soil pressure in [kN/m^2], which is related to the width of the foundation as surface tension."
Is it possible to enter only half of a symmetrical construction? This would facilitate modeling and speed up calculation.,"In RSTAB and RFEM, the symmetry cannot be used in the sense that only half of the system has to be calculated.However, it is possible to first create only half of the system including loads and then use the menu functions ""Edit → Select → All"" and then ""Edit → Mirror"" to generate the other half. In the Mirror dialog, the ""Create a copy"" option must be activated, and under the [Details] the ""Copy loads"" option.With this, one can refer to supports in the mirror axis and get realistic results."
How to enter the member foundations? The question arises for a bored pile that is oriented in the global Z direction and has different horizontal beddings in the global X and Y directions.,"The parameters for entering the elastic member foundations are based on the coefficients of the surface foundations.The coefficients always refer to the local member axes (x, y, z). The coefficients C1,x, C1,y and C1,z thus describe the displacement spring values in the direction of the local member axes (x, y , z).The value Cφ expresses a hindrance to the torsion of the rod around its longitudinal axis.The values C2,x , C2,y and C2,z take into account the shear capacity of the subsoil in the direction of the local member axes (x, y, z).The input always refers to a width of 1 m. If the bar has a smaller width, you must include this in the coefficients, e.g. E.g. for a 30 cm wide member C1,z = 10000 kN/m³ x 0.3 m = 3000 kN/m².For entering different horizontal beddings in global X - and Y-direction, you should first consider the local axes of the member. Then you can enter the spring constants according to the directions."
Can I use the STEEL module to output a parts list for a specific cross-section?,"Yes. In the general data, select only the members of the required cross-section for the design. The easiest way to do this is to display the members of the cross-section as Visibility and then select graphically by opening a window."
In STEEL you can select the voltage Sigma Delta in the details. What voltage is this?,"With the Sigma Delta stress, the maximum difference between the normal stresses is determined. This shows the existing difference between the stresses that exist in the different load cases. Therefore, only an existing stress value is output in the result tables, no associated load cases or ratios.If e.g. For example, if there are only bars under pure tensile loading, the difference between the lowest and the highest stress is specified as a value for Sigma Delta. This allows the difference from different load cases to be recorded.The Sigma Delta stresses can be used for a proof of fatigue strength."
Are the surfaces in RFEM calculated as torsion-resistant or torsion-resistant plates?,"The surfaces are considered as drill-rigid objects in the calculation by default.In the Modify Stiffnesses tab of the ""Edit Surface"" dialog, it is possible to assign ""Multiplication Factors"" to a surface for the assigned to individual stiffness matrix elements. The torsional stiffness can be individually controlled by reducing the k33 coefficient.This tab is not available for orthotropic surfaces. In this case, the stiffnesses can be adjusted in the ""Edit surface stiffness - orthotropic"" dialog."
Is it possible in FUND Pro to calculate a foundation slab with four support points on an overall slab?,"FUND Pro can be used to design pocket and block foundations for point supports. Foundation slabs can also be designed, but only for individual columns. A foundation slab with several supports on a total slab cannot be treated, since a pure design of the column supports does not take into account the interaction with the other supports and the The slab load-bearing behavior is taken into account.The FE program RFEM is suitable for the design of the entire floor slab. There z. For example, the RSTAB file can be read in, expanded with the area of the floor slab and then designed."
Is it possible to switch the page layout of the printout report to the format according to issue 504 (bridge construction)?,"Unfortunately, a layout as a bridge construction form is not integrated in RSTAB and RFEM. The page layout of the printout report can be changed, but not to the required extent. Only the font sizes and spacing can be edited.In order for you to be able to enter the data in the form, I can currently only give you a detour via the integrated interfaces. You can use the printout report e.g. B. export to an RTF file and then transfer the data from it to the form.You can do the same with the help of the interface to the statics text program VCmaster."
"When verifying building cores with the SHAPE-THIN program and partial cross-sections, the following question arises:The horizontal force does not act in the shear center. A torsional moment must therefore be entered in order to obtain partial forces or shear stresses in the cross sections.Does the occurring torsional moment have to be entered here as M_tsek or M_tpri?","If the horizontal force does not act in the shear center, so that torsion occurs, a secondary torsional moment M_xs must be applied for correct consideration. Then you get the partial transverse forces from torsion V_y,k and V_z,k, the load the partial cross-section k and which are added to the partial transverse forces from bending.On the contrary, a primary torsional moment M_xp is to be applied if the torsion of bracing systems is not originally caused by the horizontal force (at a distance from the shear center), but directly by the applied torsional moment."
"All verifications are fulfilled when verifying with FE-BUCKLING. Nevertheless, the critical load factor is less than 1. Is the check fulfilled or not?","This phenomenon is quite possible, because the load distribution factor is calculated without the influence of the plastic reserves - i.e. purely elastic. In the buckling analysis according to EN 1993-1-5, however, plastic load-bearing reserves are mobilized. The proof is thus fulfilled."
Which entries are required in the concrete modules RF-/CONCRETE Columns and RF-/CONCRETE Members if the stability analysis of a frame system made of concrete is to be carried out according to the second-order theory?,"In RF-/CONCRETE Columns, the design is based on the method with nominal curvatures. When verifying the flexural strength, the program independently determines whether a standard design is sufficient or should be designed with the moments according to the second-order theory. The load combinations to be designed should therefore be created with the option to determine the internal forces according to the first-order theory. Furthermore, the eccentricity is determined by the program through imperfections. The load cases/combinations to be designed must therefore be specified without imperfections.In RF-/CONCRETE Members, the design can be performed according to the general calculation method. The load combinations to be designed are to be created with the option to determine the internal forces according to the second-order theory. Imperfections must also be taken into account. A non-linear calculation must then be carried out, taking into account the cracked state."
How can I transfer the project data and settings from my old computer to a new PC?,"The directory structure in the project manager is managed in the PRO.DLP file. By default, it is located in the C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\Global\Project Manager folder. You can check the directory paths of the project manager in the ""Program Options"" dialog (Project Manager menu ""Edit → Program Options"").If you copy the PRO.DLP file from the old computer to the corresponding folder on the new PC, the original structure restored in the project manager. The integration of the individual projects is then unnecessary. Important: In order for the project links to be correct on the new computer, the projects must be in the same locations. Therefore, copy the project files to the directories and folders of the same name on the new computer. In addition, you can transfer the user-defined libraries:Printout protocol printhead DlubalProtocolConfigNew.cfg in the folder C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\Global\General DataSample protocols RstabProtocolConfig.cfg (RSTAB) in the folder C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\RSTAB 8.xx\General Data or RfemProtocolConfig.cfg (RFEM) in the folder C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\RFEM 5.xx\General DataUser profile library EigProf.dat in the folder C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\RSTAB8.xx\General Data (RSTAB) or C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\RFEM 5.xx\General Data (RFEM) User material library The material library consists of two files: Materialien.dbd and Materialien_User.dbd in the folder C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\RSTAB 8.xx \General Data (RSTAB) or C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\RFEM 5.xx\General Data (RFEM)"
"Is it possible to align the FE mesh manually in RFEM?In my example, there are ""rigid"" triangular elements at the edge, whereas square elements would be more realistic here.","Manual alignment of the FE mesh is possible in RFEM using ""Auxiliary points"".During mesh generation, each entered point acts as a constraint point for the FE mesh and you can design it individually. Here, the option ""Integrate unused objects into the surfaces"" must be activated.When entering the length of the FE elements, you must ensure that the global mesh is not smaller than the distances between the points. The ""normal"" points are used as auxiliary points."
How can I change the distance between the dividing lines in the sections? The distance is too big for my position.,"The distance between the division lines of the sections shown in the graphic is determined by the length of the FE elements.These settings can be changed globally in the ""Calculation"" → ""FE mesh settings"" menu or for subareas in the menu ""Insert"" → ""Model data"" → ""FE mesh refinements"". The pitch in the sections changes as the target length of the finite elements changes."
How can the scaling of the results in sections be changed in RFEM?,"You can set the scaling of the line of internal forces, ie the sizes of the parabola stitches, in the window of the result control panel in the tab of display factors.You can open the control panel via the menu item ""View"" -> ""Control panel"" or call up the button of the same name.In this window you can set the display factors for all the results displayed."
"Area results are reported in a 500mm grid. However, the decisive value is not recorded. How can I change the grid spacing?","The tabular results are output at the grid points of each area. The printout report also uses this grid.Double-click the area to open the ""Edit area"" dialog. There, select the ""Grid"" tab.Now enter distances b and h, which are matched to the model geometry. Individual settings (grid origin, rotation) are also possible via the ""Custom"" control field."
How can I influence the x-locations in the member result tables?,"The x-locations (distance of the N-th points) are determined based on the member division. Additional member divisions can be defined in the dialog or in Table 1.6 or 1.16.Member divisions allow you to specify points on members where internal forces and deformations are output in the result tables and in the numerical expression. A member division has neither an influence on the determination of the extreme values nor on the graphic result curve (RFEM uses a finer division internally). In most cases, therefore, member divisions are not required.Note: The member division for the graphical result curve is controlled via the global calculation parameters."
How can I create a PDF file from the printout report?,"Of course, the printout report can also be printed out as a PDF. On the one hand, you can choose a PDF printer as the printer. However, it is better to use the program's internal PDF export. The function can be found in the ""File"" printout report menu under ""Export to PDF"".One of the advantages of this variant is that the corresponding bookmarks are also created for each chapter in the PDF file."
"How does it affect the internal forces if I limit the number of iteration steps to ""1"" in the calculation parameters?","The calculation will be finished faster. BUT: Since only one iteration was calculated, the results are only correct if only one iteration is needed for the calculation. This applies, for example, to load cases according to the 1st order theory. Objects with non-linear properties such as tension and compression members must also not fail.Load combinations according to the second order theory, on the other hand, require an iterative calculation. The results from just one iteration are therefore not correct.The number of possible iterations should always be set sufficiently high. The value can also be much larger than the number of iterations actually required: only as many iterations as required are run through.The number of iterations carried out is shown in the result table 4.0."
"After importing a CAD model, there are geometric problems: some nodes are very close to each other, so there is no connection in some places. How can these nodes be united?","Via the menu ""Extras"" -> ""Regenerate Model"" allows nodes that are close to each other to be merged. Set the geometric tolerance and regenerate the model."
How can I change the size of the load arrows?,"Right-click the load arrow and then select ""Increase display size"" or ""Decrease display size"" from the context menu.Detailed settings are possible via the display properties, which are also accessible via the load context menu are. Distance, size, color, etc. can be adjusted individually for each load object.The size of the load vectors also has limit settings that are based on the size of the overall model. These limits can be checked and changed if necessary via the [Settings] button."
How can I detect overlapping sticks and delete one of them?,"The model check of RSTAB and RFEM enables you to find members lying on top of each other.Find double members:""Extras"" menu → ""Model check "" → ""Overlapping bars"". Duplicate members are specified in a dialog sorted by groups. A superfluous member can be deleted as follows: deselect (click in an empty area) and then click the member with the right mouse button. You can now use the ""Delete member"" function in the member context menu.Tip:In the menu ""Edit"" → ""Allow double members"". the option of generally excluding overlapping members.Alternatively, the pairs of members can also be output as an Excel list or sections can be generated with the model control. With the visibilities created in this way, the relevant members can be found and deleted very quickly in the model."
"During the dynamic calculation I get the message: ""No free mass is assigned to the model. The dynamic calculation is therefore not possible"" or ""Too many eigenvalues required"". How can I calculate the mode shapes?","As many eigenvalues can be determined as there are degrees of freedom in the system to which a mass is assigned. To determine the number of degrees of freedom, the number of nodal points or FE nodes must be multiplied by the activated mass directions. Masses in fixed supports are not to be taken into account because they cannot oscillate freely.If the 'Division for straight members' (RFEM) / 'Internal member division' (RSTAB) is not activated, it can e.g . B. in the case of single-span beams, this means that masses only exist in the supports and therefore no eigenvalues can be determined. In such cases, activate the member division as shown in the pictures.Since the Lanczos solver in RF-DYNAM Pro is not able to determine all existing eigenvalues, the ""root of the characteristic polynomial""."
"In the tables of internal forces for the members, some x-locations appear twice with the designation ""Left"" and ""Right"". What does that mean?","There are discontinuities at these points, e.g. B. as a result of a concentrated load. The internal forces at the cut edges are marked with ""Left"" and ""Right""."
I would like to have a graphic rotated by 90 degrees in the printout report. What is the easiest way to achieve this?,"If you want to rotate graphics by 90° in the printout report, you can do this via the properties of the graphics.To do this, right-click on the graphic in the report. In the context menu that appears, select ""Properties"".In the ""Properties"" tab, you can then enter the desired angle for rotating the graphic."
"I have divided a staff by several nodes. When applying the imperfections, each partial member is now assigned its own imperfection.How can I define an imperfection for all partial members?","If a member consists of several partial members, the objects to which the imperfection should refer must be specified when defining the imperfection. The following options are available:MembersThe imperfection acts on one member or individually on several members.List of membersThe imperfection affects all members that are to be defined in a list. The pre-deformations and misalignments are not applied to each member individually, but as a total imperfection to all members of the list of members. Imperfections can be applied to all members via a list of members without having to define a continuous member.Sets of membersThe imperfection acts on one set of members or on several sets of members. As with a list of members, the parameters are applied to all members contained in the set of members.The automatic generation of imperfections or imperfect systems is possible with the additional modules RSIMP and RF-IMP possible."
Can I define a nodal support in RSTAB or RFEM in such a way that it does not absorb uplift forces?,"Nodal supports can be provided with nonlinear properties (failure criteria for tensile or compressive forces, work and stiffness diagrams).The list of nonlinearities includes the following options:• Failure of the component if bearing force or moment is negative or positive• Complete failure of the bearing if bearing force or moment is negative or positive• Partial effect• Diagram• Friction as a function of other bearing forcesFailure if bearing force/torque is negative or positiveThe two options are simple Decide whether the bearing can only absorb positive or negative forces or moments: If the internal force (force or moment) acts in the forbidden direction, this component of the bearing fails. The other restraints and restraints are still effective.Failure all if bearing force/torque is negative or positiveIn contrast to the failure of a single component described above the bearing fails completely as soon as the component is ineffective.Bearings with a non-linear effect are shown in a different color in the graphic. In the table, a bearing component with nonlinear properties can be identified by the blue box. "
I am investigating a two-hinged frame with FE-LTB. I have defined the supports and the beam as continuous members.Why is the clamping moment of the beam in the supports not taken into account?,"The restraint moment is not taken into account because the continuous members have been defined separately for the beam and the columns. FE-LTB only reads in the model data and loads (point and member loads) that belong to the defined set of members. Internal forces from RSTAB are not taken into account. So you have to try to map the system as realistically as possible in FE-LTB.Due to the introduction of the 7th degree of freedom (warping), the RSTAB internal forces cannot be used. You 'cut' out a continuous member from the system and also the associated loads. The corresponding boundary conditions (bearings, joints, springs) must also be specified here. The calculation according to warping torsion (th. II. order) then provides internal forces that refer to the load and structural system defined in FE-LTB. If you now want to take internal forces from adjacent components into account, you must also define these as concentrated loads or member loads in FE-LTB.In order to carry out the lateral-torsional buckling analysis of the two-hinged frame as simply as possible with FE-LTB, the entire frame can be defined as a continuous member.For the verification of the stability with FE-LTB, the approach of imperfections is necessary. A pre-deformation is not simply queried for each member, but the mode shape is scaled to the specified value."
Are warping stresses in torsionally stressed components also considered in RFEM/RSTAB and in the STEEL or RF-STEEL Members modules?,"No. Warping torsion is irrelevant in RFEM/RSTAB or the add-on module RF-/STEEL. The warping resistance has no influence on the members here.RF-/STEEL calculates the torsional stresses approximately using MT/WT or MT/(IT/z). With this approach, the warping torsion (primary and secondary torsion or warping bi-moment) is not taken into account.The warping is defined in the additional modules RF-/FE-LTB, RF-/STEEL warping torsion and the cross-section program THIN-THIN.RF-/STEEL warping torsion is an extension of the add-on module RF -/STEEL EC3. This allows lateral-torsional buckling of members according to the second-order theory with seven degrees of freedom and mode-affine imperfection approach. These verifications are based on the EN 1993-1-1:2005 + AC:2009 standard.You can find more information in a webinar on ""Warping analysis and plastic design in RF-/STEEL EC3"" that you below at the Links download."
How can the moment curve come about? It looks as if the cantilevered part of the plate is supported on its outer edge and a moment under the concentrated load is created.,"This moment curve is due to the load-bearing effect of the slab: Because the concentrated load only acts on a small part of the area, the entire cantilever area does not deform downwards evenly. The greater the distance from the load, the smaller the deformation.The neighboring areas thus provide support for this part, which explains this moment curve. Only when the line load is related to the entire width does the expected moment curve result. This then corresponds to that of a member.When calculating with RFEM and RSTAB, note the different load-bearing behavior of surfaces and members."
What does the triangle mean for the internal forces in the printout report?,"This marking indicates that these values are the extreme values of the internal forces. In the results table of RSTAB and RFEM, these values are shown in bold.Bold would be unappealing in the report. In a result combination, two values are always specified for each internal force: maximum and minimum."
How can I insert and reformat my own text in the printout report?,"User-defined texts can be inserted into the report in two ways.In the Text block variant (""Insert"" menu), the text can be entered manually or in a separate dialog inserted from another file using [CTRL]+[V]. Here z. For example, the font size and font can be formatted.In the Text file variant (""Insert"" menu), the formatting of the text is used according to the original file."
What do the symbols in the graphic representation of the eigenmodes of the add-on module RF-/DYNAM Pro mean?,"The symbols in the RF-/DYNAM Pro graphic are intended to indicate that these members have a local torsional twist. Since the members in the graphic are related to the centroidal axis, twisting cannot be recognized otherwise . For this reason, the display with the short vertical line with the small end circles was chosen.You can then see in the animation that these symbols rotate and thus represent the twisting."
Is it possible to calculate with American steel profiles?,"Many profiles according to American standards are integrated in the cross-section library.The following profile types are included, for example:W profiles, M profiles, S profiles, HP profiles, WT profiles, C profilesIn addition to determining the internal forces, there is also the option of dimensioning the steel profiles in accordance with ANSI/AISC 360-10. The RF-/STEEL AISC module is required for this. "
"I would like to calculate my system according to the second order theory and have created several load cases, including imperfection load cases. Do I have to group the load cases into load combinations or result combinations?","If you want to calculate according to the second order theory, you must define load combinations. In the case of a load combination, the loads of the load cases contained are combined into ""one large load case"", taking into account the respective partial safety factors, which can then be calculated according to the second order theory.At a result combination, on the other hand, the contained load cases are calculated first. The results are then superimposed taking into account the partial safety factors. The calculation theory cannot be set for the EKs. This is only possible for load cases and load combinations.For load cases and load combinations, the calculation theory can be specified in the calculation parameters, eg theory of the second order. If the model has members of the ""cable"" type, these elements are always calculated according to the third order theory.Unique internal forces are always output for load cases and load combinations. Result combinations, on the other hand, contain an envelope of the internal forces (max and min values). Since the results of load cases and load combinations are superimposed in the result combinations, the ECs can contain results according to the 1st or 2nd order.In your model, you can use the LCs in an overall EC with the Or criterion (e.g. EK1 = LK1/constant or LK2/constant or LK3/constant ...). This gives you the maximum internal forces and deformations, taking into account the second order theory.The ""Constant-or-superposition"" means that one of the LCs is always used for the results . If the results in the EKs are linked with a ""possibly-or-overlay"", it is also possible that none of the LKs will be used. The internal forces and deformations can then become zero."
Is it possible to change the dimension font size?,"You can change the font size for the dimensions under the display properties.You can access these via the menu ""Options"" → ""Display properties"" → ""Edit"" or via the context menu (click with the right mouse button into the free workspace).Under the tab ""General"" → ""Dimensioning"" → ""Dimensioning"" you can then ""Set the font"" for the dimensions. More settings for dimensions, line type, thickness and color can be found in the same tab.NoteIf you have made several changes like this, you would like to If you don't use them all the time, you can create and save different configurations in the configuration manager. These configurations include these same display properties."
Can the principal stresses also be represented as trajectories or as vectors?,The vector representation of the principal stresses is possible if you display the angle alpha under the stresses in the Results navigator.The values for Sigma-1 and Sigma-2 are then shown separately for the stress in the direction of the main axes on the positive/negative surface side and the membrane stress in the direction of the main axes in vectorial form.The scale of the trajectories can be controlled with the factor for trajectories in the control panel 
Is there a way to graphically display the course of line support forces with any number of values?Only 2 values are given by default.,"On the results of the line supports, only two values (max and min) are displayed by default.You can use the ""Show"" navigator to display all values:""Results"" → ""Support reactions"" → ""Actual"" → ""All values""The division depends on the FE mesh, a value is output at each FE node.You can, for example, influence the division by means of an FE mesh refinement on certain surfaces or lines. The numerical output in the results table and thus also in the printout report is only controlled by the global FE mesh."
"I only defined one element. If I interchange the long and short sides (ie the thickness becomes the length), the St. Venant's torsion area moment is calculated incorrectly.","THIN-THIN is (as the program name suggests) designed for thin-walled cross-sections. The cross-section values are determined according to the thin-wall theory. Strictly speaking, this theory only applies if the ratio of thickness to length is less than 1/10.THIN-THIN calculates the torsional moment of inertia using the equation. The element thickness t* delivers power values, which explains the differences when the thicknesses are swapped.The It,St.Ven. results, that result with a very large element thickness are therefore not usable and should be evaluated accordingly even after transfer to RFEM/RSTAB.You should therefore confirm the query that SHAPE-THIN issues before the calculation of an incorrectly modeled element."
"want to use couplings in the model. What is the difference between coupling, dummy rigid and rigid bars?","A coupling bar is a virtual bar with definable rigid or articulated properties. There are four ways to couple the degrees of freedom of the start and end nodes. The normal and shear forces or torsional and bending moments are transferred directly from node to node. Couplings can be used to model special situations for force and moment transfers. If you enter the section designation Dummy Rigid , you can use a member with high rigidity, taking into account joints or other member properties. In RFEM 5 and RSTAB 8, the dummy rigid has been replaced by the rigid member. For reasons of compatibility, however, the dummy rigid can still be used.The stiffnesses of these members are calculated as a function of the member length L:EAx = GIx = 10^13 ⋅ LEIy = EIz = 10^13 ⋅ L^3GAy = GAz = 10^15 ⋅ L (RFEM) or GAy = GAz = 0 (RSTAB)with EAx : extensional stiffness GIx : torsional stiffness EI : bending stiffness GA : Shear Stiffness"
"What is the difference between the basic internal forces, principal internal forces and design internal forces in RFEM?","Basic internal forcesThese are the surface internal forces that are related to the local coordinate system (x,y,z) of the surface. The x and y axes lie in the plane, the z axis is perpendicular to the plane. The bending moment mx, for example, represents the bending moment that generates bending stresses in the x-direction (not around the x-axis!).Principal internal forcesThese are the internal forces related to the main axes (1,2,3) of the surface. The internal forces in the direction of axis 1 represent the maximum values. The angle between the surface axis x and axis 1 is output as αb for bending moments.Design internal forces b>These internal forces are required for the reinforced concrete design. The positive or negative side of the surface is marked with + and -.The surface internal forces are described in detail in the RFEM manual ."
Is it possible in RSTAB and RFEM to change the direction of a specific force component at all existing nodal loads?,"You can quickly change the direction of a specific force component at all existing nodal loads using the navigator or the input mask.In the navigator, double-click on the line of the desired nodal forces of the corresponding load case. In the following ""Nodal force"" dialog, you can assign the component to a different direction.In input mask 3.1, for example, it is possible to use the block functions to change the direction for all existing nodal forces. To do this, first select the column for the nodal forces and copy them with the key combination ""Ctrl+C"". Then switch to the desired column and paste the entries from the clipboard again (key combination ""Ctrl+V""). If it already contains values, it is necessary to delete them beforehand."
"In the FUND Pro add-on module, a steel list and the concrete cubature appear in the last two result masks. How can I print these two pages?","You can select the two masks ""Steel list"" and ""Concrete cubature"" in the printout report.To do this, switch to the global selection in the printout report (menu item ""Edit""), select under program FUND Pro and then the ""Results 1"" tab. There you check the reinforcement plans and click on the ""Details"" behind it.In the ""Reinforcement plans that can be displayed"" window that now appears, select the ""Parts list"".After confirming with [ OK] the parts list and also the concrete cubature are displayed together in one graphic."
Why are the bar sections locked in the SHAPE-THIN library?,"Round profiles are blocked in the SHAPE-THIN profile library because they represent relatively solid cross-sections and therefore cannot be calculated according to the theory for thin-walled cross-sections. A round bar can only be roughly modeled as a rectangular element. Such cross-sections should therefore be calculated as solid cross-sections in the DICKQ program.To simplify things, it would be possible to define circular cross-sections in SHAPE-THIN as pipes with a large wall thickness."
"Can I export the animations to RSTAB/RFEM (displacements, auto-rotation of the rendered model) so that I can show them in presentations without RSTAB/RFEM?","Via the menu Extras> Create video file you can save the animations as an .avi file. The menu bars, navigator bars and tables are not taken into account.You have the option of selecting different video file types. You can also control the quality and the number of frames per second. Please consider: The smaller the time intervals, the larger the file will be, but the smoother the video will be."
"To create information brochures, we need some graphics from our projects from RFEM/RSTAB.How can I save the graphics in addition to printing them to the clipboard or generate them for further processing in RFEM/RSTAB?","Unfortunately, the graphics cannot be read directly in JPG or BMP format. The clipboard print option allows you to paste graphics into other programs that allow editing and saving as BMP or PNG files. However, a changed background color is not adopted.Windows offers the ""Snipping Tool"" accessory. This is a screen printing program that you can use to create graphics in GIF, PNG and JPG format.Of course, there are also professional programs such as B. Snagit®. When inserting graphics z. In PowerPoint, for example, you should not change the size by dragging the edges, otherwise the display will become pixelated. If you would like to have it in a different size, you can adjust this in the image editing program (pixels, etc.) or print the image again with a different view."
"How can I save files with no results without archiving them? I don't want to ""explode"" the amounts of data, but want to be able to access the input files quickly.","The easiest way to do this is to choose Save As from the File pull-down menu.

The You can also delete the results of the current model using the ""Results → Existing results"" pull-down menu.Another option is to select the ""Results"" entry in the Data navigator with the right-click and then select the ""Delete all results"" option.You can also simply move a node in the model: this will delete all results. You then execute the Undo function, which returns the node to its previous position. Now save the model with no results."
"For a member with an unsymmetrical cross-section, the load plane passes through the centroid of the cross-section, not through its shear center. Therefore, a torsional stress would have to occur. But why is MT = 0 ?","In RFEM and RSTAB, the loads are always referred to the shear center. A planned torsion due to the profile geometry (centre of gravity is not the same as the center of shear) is therefore not recorded. The graphic with the system line (gravity axis) and the load applied to it can lead to a wrong conclusion.In order to record the torsion as a result of a load that does not act in the shear center, an additional torsional moment (load times the distance to the shear center).Alternatively, a calculation can be performed with the RF-/STEEL EC3 Warping Torsion module. There it is possible to apply the load at the center of gravity."
"Is it possible to save the changed settings for the display properties (e.g. line thickness, color) in a file?","If you have made changes and want to transfer them to another computer, for example, or import them again after a new installation, you can save your configuration file and import it again if necessary. To do this, select ""Options"" → ""Configuration Manager"" from the menu "" the command ""Export configuration as file"" and enter a name for the configuration file in the following dialog. You can then import the saved file again via the same menu item, only now ""Transfer configuration from file""."
Is there a way to automatically import the buckling lengths of the members calculated in RSBUCK or RF-STABILITY into RF-/STEEL EC3?,"The buckling lengths calculated in RSBUCK or RF-STABILITY can be transferred to RF-/STEEL EC3.To do this, please click in window 1.5 Effective Lengths - Members or 1.6 Effective Lengths - Sets of Members in the cell of the buckling length factor kcr (lower table).

"I have the following problem in RF-/FE-LTB: In order to examine the effect of the load application point, I have defined the eccentricity ez as positive and negative. A positive value, load application on the lower chord, should actually contribute to stabilizing the system. However, this is not the case. What do I have to consider here?","The definition of the load application point in RF-/FE-LTB depends on the local member axis system. For example, define B. a horizontal bar (global Z-axis points downwards), the z-axis of the local axis system also points downwards, in the positive Z-direction. If the load is now to act on the upper side, then a negative value must be entered for ez. With a horizontal bar, it doesn't matter in which direction the bar runs, the local axis z always points downwards.The situation is different with a vertical bar. In this case, the member direction is from top to bottom and the local axis z of the local axis system points in the negative X direction. If a positive value is now entered for the eccentricity ez, this corresponds to a load entry on the top chord and thus leads to a greater utilization.You can display the local axis system of each member in the ""Show"" navigator Activation of the option ""Member axis systems x,y,z"" under ""Model"" -> Turn on ""Staves""."
What options are there for exporting an existing project to Bentley ProStructures (ProSteel and ProConcrete) and STAAD.Pro? How should this be done?,"There are two ways to export to Bentley ProStructures. 1. Export via the product interface Export the data via the steel product interface ""Bentley ProStructure"" in a *.stp format and import this file into the target program. You can find this interface via the ""File > Export"" menu in the Formats for frameworks section. With the steel construction product interface (*.stp), the complete static system with materials, cross-sections, releases, loads, combinations, supports and results. This format is regulated according to the DSTV product interface for steel construction (http://www.dlubal.de/download/pss_dstv.pdf). The DSTV interface (*.stp) is used e.g. E.g. supported by Bentley ProStructure, Tekla Structures, Bocad, Intergraph Frameworks, Advanced Steel and Cadwork. 2. Export via the Bentley ISM interface Export the data via the ""Bentley ISM"" interface in a *.ism.dgn format and import this file into the target program.

"When generating the FE mesh, the message appears that an internal node is too far away.",This message is issued when an integrated node (node in the middle of a surface) is not in the surface plane.You can solve the problem by moving the node into the surface plane or delete the node number from the list of objects integrated into the surface.
Only the maximum value is displayed graphically in the deformation figur. Is it possible in RSTAB/RFEM to also display the maximum deformation of each member?,"You can display the maximum deformation of each member by activating the ""Show extreme values"" option in the ""Show"" navigator under ""Results"" → ""Deformation"" → ""Members"".Note If you have made several changes and want to use them again and again, you can set the entire ""Show"" navigator setting as the default setting. To do this, right-click in the free Navigator area and select the command ""Save settings as default""."
Result combinations calculated in RSTAB contain min/max values and associated internal forces. Why are these associated internal forces not considered in KAPPA? Which internal forces does KAPPA use for the verification?,"RF-/KAPPA uses the internal forces My or Mz at the respective verification point for verification method 1. If the maximum values of My and Mz occur at different points in the member, the associated internal forces may be applied. This is ensured by the verification at different x-points.In contrast to this, with Verification method 2 the maximum values of the moments must always be applied over the entire length of the member, even if they are not occur at the same point in the staff. As a result, the bending component in the design criterion is always constant for the entire member or continuous member.The moment coefficient βm for recording the shape of the bending moments My and Mz is always set to 1.1 or 1.0 (depending on the verification method) for a result combination. The combination of results represents an envelope from which the form of the moment coefficient cannot be determined unambiguously."

"In the ""Edit load cases"" dialog of the ""Self-weight"" load case, you can take the self-weight of the structure into account in the [Basic data].How can the considered self-weight of the structure be displayed graphically?","The display of the self-weight of the entered structure can be activated via the project navigator - Show.To do this, the check mark under ""Load"" → ""Self-weight"" must be set."
Can I calculate several models one after the other (e.g. overnight) without calling them up one after the other and calculating them separately?,"You can calculate several models at once:Open all models that you want to calculate.Then start the calculation with the menu ""Calculation → All Calculate results for all open models"".You can decide whether all results, only the results of the main program or only the results of the add-on module should be calculated."

"Before a result combination is calculated, the message appears that the addition of the load cases is not permitted due to failing objects. What does that mean?","For result combinations, in which load cases are superimposed with '+', incorrect results can occur in connection with non-linear objects (tension or compression members, bearing failure, etc.). Example: A tension member receives compression in a load case and fails. The member results are zero in this load case. In another load case, however, this member is under tension, which means that it remains in the system and adopts internal forces. If you now add the results of these load cases in a result combination, two different static systems would be superimposed. This can be problematic.With nonlinear objects in the model, it is therefore better to form load combinations."
How are the signs of the bar moments defined?,"The bending moment My is positive if tensile stresses occur on the positive side of the member (in the direction of the z-axis). Mz is positive if there are compressive stresses on the positive member side (in the direction of the y axis).The sign definition for torsional moments, normal and lateral forces corresponds to the usual conventions: The internal forces are positive if they act in a positive direction on the positive shear edge."
Why are different buckling length coefficients calculated for a buckling figur?,"RSBUCK uses an instantaneous image of the normal force distribution in the respective load condition. The normal forces are increased iteratively until the critical load case occurs. In the numerical calculation, this stability load is characterized by the fact that the determinant of the stiffness matrix is zero.If the critical load factor is known, the buckling load and the buckling figure are determined from it. The buckling lengths and buckling length coefficients are then determined for this lowest buckling load.Example: Pendulum support with a length of 20 m, cross section HE-B 500, self-weight loadFor the The first buckling figure results in a buckling length coefficient of kcr,y = 2.92 for buckling about the major axis. For buckling around the weak axis, the buckling load of 651.3 kN results in a buckling length coefficient of 1.00.If you use the formula to determine the buckling load Ncr = pi ^2 * E * I / Lcr^2 to Lcr and sets Ncr = 651.3 kN and Iy = 107200 cm^4, the resulting buckling length Lcr,y is 58.4 m and from this the buckling length coefficient kcr,y of 2.92.In RSBUCK, the two buckling length coefficients are determined for each buckling figure and buckling load.Um to read the correct buckling length coefficient for deflection perpendicular to the y-axis (buckling around the strong axis), several buckling figures (mode shapes) must be calculated. Then the correct value can be selected in mask 2.1. In the example, it is the third buckling figure with a buckling load of 5485.5 kN. For this load, the buckling lengths and factors are determined: kcr,y = 1.0 and kcr,z = 0.345.For a square cross-section, there are two equal buckling lengths, since the stiffnesses are the same in both directions."
"When calculating the buckling lengths of a simple system, I get a buckling length Lcr,y that is too large for the first buckling figur. Why is that?","In RSBUCK and RF-STABILITY, the lowest buckling load is calculated first. This results, for example, for a pendulum support (Euler case 1, IPE profile) for buckling around the z-axis. The buckling length Lcr,y is then retrospectively determined with this buckling load.In order to read off the correct buckling length for Lcr,y, the second is therefore required buckling figure (eigenform) to consider. To do this, specify at least two or more buckling figures for the calculation in the basic data. In the second buckling figur, there is a higher buckling load (deflection around the y-axis), with which the corresponding buckling length Lcr,y is calculated.As the example shows, is in RSBUCK or RF-STABILITY, the calculation of several buckling figures (mode shapes) is necessary. This allows the results for the individual directions to be read."
How can I delete empty load cases and reorder the remaining ones?,"You can delete a load case in the navigator or via the pull-down menu ""File"" → ""Model data"". In the navigator switch to ""Load cases and combinations"" → ""Load cases"" and then click the load case to be deleted with the Right-click and select ""Delete"". It is not possible to automatically move up the next load case instead of the deleted one. The easiest way to sort load cases is to use the table. To do this, simply select and copy the respective rows and paste them back into the desired row. Alternatively, you can also use the ""Renumber → Move"" function to rearrange the load cases. "
Installing an update erased my company headers. Where is this data stored so I can back it up before the next installation?,"All log headers that you have created in the printout report using the ""Settings → Log header"" pull-down menu are saved in the DlubalProtocolConfigNew.cfg"" file. You will find this in the Dlubal master data directory (default: C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\Global\General Data). Changes in this file only take effect when you save the model.In the RfemProtocolConfig.cfg file or RstabProtocolConfig.cfg the details for your printout report template are saved. You should also back up these files before reinstalling.If you have created a combination scheme, do this this is stored in the KombinSchema.dat file in the master data directory.You can also back up the entire General Data folder before the next installation in order to save the to keep custom files.The projects linked in the project manager are managed in the PRO.DLP file, which by default is located in the C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\ folder Global\Project Manager.

How can I display the local axis systems in RFEM and reverse the local z-axis?,"Each surface has a local coordinate system (x,y,z) in RFEM.The coordinates x and y are in the surface, z is perpendicular to the surface. The top and bottom of a face is determined by the direction of the z-axis.The direction in which the local z-axis is pointing is the bottom of a face. Normally this local z-axis points down. However, depending on the definition direction of the boundary lines and the order in which the lines were clicked, it may also be possible that the local z-axis points up.But this can be easily corrected. First, please display the local area coordinate systems.Proceed as follows:On the left side of the screen, activate the project navigator - Show.Open the ""Model"" → ""Surfaces"" branch and activate the check box in front of the ""Surface axis systems x,y,z"" entry.To reverse the direction of the local z-axis, click Now right-click on the area in question and select ""Reverse local axis system"" from the context menu.It is not possible to rotate the local x, y axes. The direction of these axes is directly dependent on the global axis and the position of the surface in relation to it. For example, define B. a surface in the x,y plane, the local x-axis points in the direction of the global x-axis. If you tilt this plate out of the plane, the local coordinate system rotates automatically."

"When designing with STEEL, I want to scroll between the designed load cases to see the different stress distributions.How is this possible?","In order to be able to compare the STEEL stresses from different load cases, the individual load cases must be assigned to different design cases.

I have a truss node that is connected to several rectangular hollow sections (modeled as an FE shell structure). To create a realistic joint it is necessary to remove the surface parts lying in the node from some cross-sections.I achieved this by intersecting and deactivating the corresponding surface parts. This greatly slows down working with the model. Is there another way to generate the node?,"The most elegant option is certainly the penetration function. When the geometry changes, the penetration is automatically adjusted, regardless of the surface types used. This makes it easy to edit the model.The disadvantage of this function is that the working speed decreases if there are several larger penetrations, since the penetration lines and thus the overall structure have to be constantly recalculated. TipsWhen editing such a model, switch to wireframe mode for a short time. This suppresses the calculation of the model for rendering, which can take a long time with more complicated models. To check, you can switch back to rendering mode at any time.The penetrations should always be created one after the other, i.e. only for two surfaces at a time, otherwise the penetration lines would be calculated from all selected surfaces and the surfaces into a corresponding number of partial surfaces would be divided. This would lead to a significant overhead in deactivation and further slowdown due to a larger number of penetration lines.Another way to create such a node is to use the ""Lines/Bars connect” (in the “Extras” menu) and then to edit the surface boundary lines in such a way that the surface parts lying in the node no longer exist. These models can be edited faster because the model does not have to be recalculated after each change. This variant can be implemented quickly if all surfaces are defined as ""flat"" surfaces. However, it cannot easily connect curved surfaces (such as pipes)."
"The isosurface representation for internal forces does not match the color scale in the results panel. However, this only occurs with result combinations. Do you have an explanation?","When viewing EK results, by default the max and min area results are displayed simultaneously.On your system, the Z-direction (top view) view is the min results visible. If you rotate the model a little, you will see the max results on the bottom.It is also possible to switch off the simultaneous display and display only the max or only the min values instead. To do this, use the options in the lower area of the ""Results"" navigator."
"A hall frame is to be designed with the program FE-LTB.When the loading is transferred from RSTAB, not all internal forces are transferred. Why not?","In FE-LTB, only the loads that act directly on the continuous member are adopted. If loads are introduced into the continuous member through connected components, then these must be added manually.Examples of this are hall frames with crane runway brackets, 3-D halls with purlin roofs, multi-span frames, etc.If a force is applied to a cantilever that is not part of the continuous member, this load must be added manually become. This load must then be shifted to the node and the offset moment must also be applied."
We use several computers with RSTAB. One crashes again and again when trying to create a printout report.What could be the reason?,"Unfortunately, the cause is not easy to determine. Please try the following solutions.Printer driverThe problem could be related to the printer driver. Please try a new (up-to-date) printer driver (if necessary, use a PDF printer as the default printer). You can find this e.g. B. at www.treiber.de.Install e.g. B. use a different printer and try to create a new printout report.Memory problemThere may also be a memory problem. It might be helpful here to save the model and only then call up the printout report. This frees up the temporary memory.Graphics cardIt could also be due to the different graphics cards on the computers. Try disabling hardware acceleration (OpenGL) in the program. You can do this under the menu ""Options"" → ""Program Options"" → ""Graphics"". After disabling hardware acceleration, restart the program. If this solves the problem, we recommend that you update your graphics card driver.Other applications in the backgroundAnother possibility would be that another application in the background is also accessing the folder of the temporary Accesses files and locks the folder when calling the protocol. Please close all other applications, then start RSTAB and try calling the report again.Perhaps the problem can also be solved by opening a new printout report or making changes to the selection before opening (Edit ) of the printout report.If the problem only occurs in the current project, try the following:Open the project manager in RSTAB and select the function in the ""Project"" pull-down menu ""Separate"". This will remove that project from the project manager. It is not deleted, only the connection to the hard disk is disconnected.Next, under RSTAB, open the position again with the ""File"" → ""Open"" command.The now The question that appears is because you have disconnected the project. Answer [Yes] and then enter a project name again. (If you answer [No], no project is assigned to the position and it appears in the printout report under Project name: Nameless.)Now open the printout report. "
A surface of my RFEM structure is inclined in space. I want to create faces perpendicular to this face.Is there an easier and more accurate way than manually calculating the point coordinates of the new faces or adding the new faces to the existing face by rotating and moving?,"It is very easy to orientate new structural elements to existing elements when defining them.In the ""Extras"" → ""Coordinate system"" pull-down menu you will find the ""New coordinate system"" command.By clicking on this button it is possible to create a user-defined coordinate system to which the work planes are aligned If the three points that define the coordinate system are chosen in such a way that these are corner points of the existing surface, then a Plane of the new coordinate system determined by the surface plane and the other two working planes are perpendicular to this."
"I want to define an orthotropic plate. In order to control the influence of the material properties on the stiffness matrix, I would like to know how the stiffness matrix is determined. Also, how is the self-weight of the orthotropic surface calculated?","In RFEM, different types of orthotropic surfaces can be defined. In the ""Stiffness matrix"" tab, the [Info] button provides information on the calculation of the respective coefficients of the stiffness matrix.The self-weight is calculated from the specific weight of the material and the information in the dialog tabs to the selected orthotropy type. Separate input fields are available for considering the self-weight, e.g. B. to indicate the equivalent thickness of the plate."
"When starting RSTAB or RFEM, I get a message that the graphics chip does not support OpenGL hardware acceleration. Unfortunately, the rendering in the programs is no longer as detailed and the work is not quite as ""smooth"". Can I still use hardware acceleration?","OpenGL technology is used for 3D rendering, which must be supported in a suitable manner by the operating system and graphics card. Since not every graphics card manufacturer is on the same level of OpenGL technology, Microsoft's technology serves as a reference. We use the Windows standard OpenGL functions. In RSTAB and RFEM you can activate or deactivate the hardware acceleration (OpenGL) via the menu ""Options"" → ""Program Options"" in the ""Graphics"" dialog tab. In the same dialog, improved smoothing (antialiasing) can be set to prevent the edge effect. These options are activated after restarting the program. The options mentioned are very dependent on the graphics card used. When working with RSTAB and RFEM, a graphics card is recommended that accelerates OpenGL functions in terms of hardware. This is the case with all current graphics cards. It is very important that the graphics card drivers are always kept up to date. We advise against graphics solutions that are integrated into the chipset or main processor (Intel HD xxxx, G xx, Q xx) . Notebooks are often equipped with two graphics chips, an energy-saving Intel HD chip integrated into the processor and an additional, more powerful graphics chip (eg from NVIDIA or AMD). In this case, it should be ensured that RSTAB and RFEM use the powerful graphics chip. In the links below this FAQ you will find further information on how this works in detail."
"When calculating a system with tension rods in the second-order theory, does the relieving effect of the tension forces have to be activated?","In general, the calculation ""with traction relief"" makes sense and is suitable for every system.The standards contain provisions in which relieving effects with a lower partial safety factor than adverse effects must be taken into account. However, varying partial safety factors would only be possible with a disproportionately high amount of effort.In RFEM and RSTAB, there is the option of generally setting tensile forces to zero. This approach is on the safe side. To do this, remove the tick in the control field.On the other hand, the standards refer to actions. It would therefore be possible to decide for each impact whether it has a negative or negative effect. An impact that is considered globally as a burden can have a local relief effect. If the normal forces are to be included in the calculation unchanged, leave the check mark in the check box."
"I stored a ceiling tile on a shear wall. The shear wall should only absorb normal forces. So I added a line hinge between the surfaces and defined it so that all internal forces except those in the ux direction have hinges. Although no hinge is defined for ux, the slab deforms without being supported by the shear wall. Where is the error?","A line hinge is the right structural element to define the connection between the individual surfaces. However, the hinge definitions of the line hinge do not refer to the internal forces in the surface, but to the local coordinate system of the line hinge.If only normal forces are to be transferred to the shear wall, the direction u is therefore uz no joint to define. All other joint directions are to be set as articulated."
Can you convert area loads to member loads in RSTAB/RFEM?,"In RSTAB/RFEM you also have the option of automatically generating member loads from area loads.You can do this using levels or cells, among other things. You can find the corresponding command for converting area loads into member loads in the pull-down menu ""Extras"" → ""Generate loads"" → ""From area load on members using plane"" or ""From area load on members using cells"".Depending on which one If you choose the command, you either have to define a surface load plane using the corner nodes or you pick the cells (on which the load should act) in the graphic. Further information on handling can also be found in our manual."
I want to adjust the values of the results and the color scale to match reinforcement areas of mesh.How does it work?,"Customizing the color scale and range of values is very easy.Use the color scale to show the results for which the scale should be adjusted. Double-clicking on the colors of the color scale takes you to the ""Edit values and color scales"" window. There you can adjust the values of the areas to be displayed by sliding the slider to the right.The values can be changed by entering or changing them in the value fields. However, make sure that the order is maintained.The color adjustment is done by double-clicking on the color to be changed.Now a color can be selected from predefined colors for the corresponding value range can be selected or a new color can be defined. The color scale and value scale can be saved to access these custom scales in other positions."
What are the options for further processing the printout report in Word or as a PDF document?,"The data can be transferred to Word in RTF format, for example. The entire printout report, including embedded graphics, is transferred. To do this, select the printout report menu ""File → Export to RTF"". You can open the created RTF file directly with Word.The integrated PDF printer is available for output as a PDF. To do this, use the printout report menu ""File → Export to PDF""."
"With a ceiling slab, I get very large shear forces in the slab and unrealistic support reactions at the support ends, which make the slab undesignable. Why is that?","The support reactions are so large that singularities arise at the ends of the line supports due to the fixed clamping. This problem can be circumvented by realistic modeling of the system: ceiling slabs that rest on shear walls are in the direction of its own weight not really fully held. Due to the rigidity of the wall, the bearing as a spring is more realistic. The spring stiffness of a line support, which is intended to simulate a wall panel, is calculated using k = (E*d) / h (with E = Young's modulus of the wall, d = thickness of the wall, h = height of the wall). Singularities can be avoided by modeling line supports with springs. The modeling of supports as springs is also useful for point supports. Here, RFEM offers the ""Column"" function when generating point supports, whereby the spring parameter is automatically calculated from the column geometry and used."
"I modeled a steel plate lying on top of a concrete slab. The steel plate deforms through the concrete slab. If I add a bedding for the steel slab, the concrete slab is not loaded.How can I establish contact between the steel slab and the concrete slab? How can I model a lift off on train?","If surfaces are not connected to each other (by surfaces or members), they can deform ""into each other"". The collision or contact of unconnected elements cannot be taken into account in the calculation.By inserting the surface bedding, the steel plate is held globally. Since there is no connection to the concrete slab, it does not pass on any internal forces to it.It is therefore necessary to connect the two surfaces with each other. This can be done using surfaces or members.To enable lifting during tension, it is possible to create a contact solid that connects both surfaces.Using the option Contact volume additional properties can be defined in addition to failure under compressive or tensile forces. These include e.g. E.g. different friction coefficients of the surface.An example of such a modeling can be seen in the pictures for this answer. Here, a front plate was coupled to the bottom plate by means of a contact volume (failure under tension). The tensile forces are transferred to the concrete slab using anchors.The contact problem can be modeled in RFEM. A volume is created between the concrete and steel plates. The volume is given the property Contact.For the contact, nonlinear properties can be defined perpendicular and parallel to the plane of the plate."
"After importing a DXF file, there are now multiple nodes with identical coordinates. How can I clean up the system in RSTAB?","This problem when importing DXF drawings cannot always be avoided.In addition to the plausibility check, you have other functions in the Extras menu Eliminate duplicate coordinates available:Connect members Connect members Plausibility check > Identical nodesRegenerate model and round off node coordinatesConnect membersWith this function, you draw over an area Window open. If members intersect with nodes there, they are automatically split.Connecting membersYou can define an area around a node or member and the nodes, that are within a certain radius connect to this node eccentrically or by shifting.Model check > Identical nodesThis allows you to select duplicate nodes. It can be specified whether unused nodes are deleted or identical nodes are merged.Regenerate modelNode coordinates with many decimal places resulting from the import, can be rounded down."
"In RSTAB/RFEM I have defined a haunched member from two different cross-sections. This is now displayed incorrectly in the rendering (see graphic ""Cooking incorrect""). What I have done wrong?","If there are different cross-section types at the beginning and end of a haunched member that do not have the same number of stress points, RSTAB/RFEM draws the first half with one cross-section and the second half with the other. It is also necessary that the stress points with the same numbers are opposite each other. A ""continuous"" haunch is drawn if both ends have the same cross-section type (section series) and the stress points are opposite. So you could e.g Copy the profile with the lower height and then adjust the height and/or width on the second cross section. NoteThe easiest way to do this is to model both cross-sections as weld profiles or parameterized cross-sections."

The line supports and point supports are displayed much too large. How can I adjust the storage size?,"By default, the support sizes are optimized for reinforced concrete structures. The easiest way to change the display size is to right-click on the support. Then select the ""Reduce display size"" option in the context menu. If this does not improve anything, use the ""Display properties"" context menu option. Limit settings apply to the size of the bearing symbols, which are based on the size of the overall model. These limits can be adjusted via the [Settings] button. The changed display properties can be saved in configurations. In this way, different display properties can be created that are adapted to various structures. Saving the current configuration and calling saved configuration files is possible via the RFEM menu ""Settings"" - ""Configuration Manager""."
"I have a model with surfaces and members. If you display the deformations in the graphic after the calculation, the members remain in their original position.However, the members are connected to the surfaces and member deformations are also displayed in the table. Why is that?","In order not to make the display too confusing, the member deformations are only displayed as lines by default.The display can be adjusted in the Project Navigator - Show so that that the member deformations are also displayed as rendered cross-sections.Furthermore, in the ""Show"" navigator it is possible to hide the undeformed model in order to view only the deformations."
"In the model, the end of a rod lies exactly on the shell of a pipe. Why does the calculation break off with the message that the model is not sufficiently supported?","Although the rod end is geometrically exactly on the tube surface, the automatic integration of elements is only possible with flat surfaces. Since the end point of the member was not integrated into the pipe surface, no common FE node is created. The member therefore has no connection to the tube for RFEM, which leads to the demolition.Integrate the member end node manually into the tube surface: Double-click the tube surface to open the ""Edit surface"" dialog box. You can then add the node in the ""Integrated"" tab as soon as the ""Automatic object recognition"" option is deactivated.The bar is connected to the pipe surface through the integration. A common FE node is generated and the calculation is carried out successfully."
"In the 3D representation in RFEM, I would like to display the surfaces with their true thickness.Where can I set this?","The rendering parameters can be set in the Project Navigator - Show. To render the faces with their true thickness, just choose the following setting:Rendering → Model → Full Model → Faces → Filled including thickness"
Where can I specify which elements are shown in the graphic?,"You can make this setting using the Project Navigator - Show.With the second tab at the bottom of the navigator, the Show Navigator enabled. Objects in the graphic can be shown or hidden in a clear tree structure. All you have to do is activate or deactivate the checkboxes in front of the entries."
Can I export the design results of RF-CONCRETE surfaces to a mesh placement program?,You can export the results to various rebar CAD programs. The export function is called in RFEM and is possible in the following programs:Glaser format (*.fem)Strakon (*.cfe)Nemetschek format (*.asf)Engineering Structural Format (*.esf)There is also a function to import design details and loads into RFEM for the following Programs:Glaser format (*.fem)Strakon (*.cfe)
How can I import a CAD drawing into RFEM and create an RFEM model from it?,"The import of DXF files e.g. B. from AutoCAD is possible.Lines of the DXF file are also generated as lines in RFEM. Thus, the geometry can be completely created by the import. The imported lines can then be used for modeling as surface boundaries or member axes.There is also the option of direct import. Descriptions of interfaces with Tekla Structures and Autodesk AutoCAD Revit are available in the manuals under Interfaces. A list of the supported interfaces/program versions is provided for each version in the Update reports listed. For this purpose, the update report of the first version must always be checked (e.g. RFEM 5-20-01).A detailed overview of the interfaces and BIM-oriented planning is available on our website Building Information Modeling (BIM).In addition, there are already numerous webinars on the subject of BIM, which can be viewed as videos on our website. "
How many eigenmodes have to be taken into account in seismic design?,"According to EN 1998-1, so many modal shapes should be used that the sum of the effective modal masses is at least 90% of the effective total mass (this usually corresponds to the total mass of the structure). This regulation can differ in other seismic standards.In the input mask of RF-/DYNAM Pro you will find a 'Mode Shapes' tab in the dynamic load cases in which frequencies and effective modal mass factors are summarized in a table. In this way you can check before the calculation whether you are determining the required number of eigenvalues or whether you need to increase the number.The effective modal masses and the factors are shown in table 5.7 Effective modal mass factors after the calculation .In this FAQ lists causes of small effective modal mass factors and possible solutions. "
don't quite understand the modeling of the elastic surface bed. In which field should I enter my bedding number? What do the other parameters of the surface bedding mean?,"In RFEM, surface subgrade is described using five parameters: On the one hand, these are the three subgrade factors in the directions related to the local surface axes (Cu,x, Cu,y and Cu,z). Cu,z is practically equal to Winkler's bedding number. It can be taken from a building ground report. A non-linearity can also be assigned to this bedding, e.g. B. Failure under tension. Describe the Cu,x and Cu,y parameters the resistance of the bedding against horizontal displacement in the respective directions. On the other hand, the parameters for considering the shear load-bearing effect of the bedding (C v,xz and Cv,yz). The bedding number z. For the bedding of a foundation, for example, Cu,z must be entered in the field, since the bedding acts perpendicular to the surface."
Which bending theory should be chosen for the calculation of plates and shells - Kirchhoff or Mindlin?,"In the ""Calculation parameters"" dialog, you can choose between the two bending theories. When calculating according to Mindlin b> Lateral force deformations are included, according to Kirchhoff these are not taken into account. This means: The Mindlin theory leads to good results for thicker plates and shells, and the Kirchhoff theory for thin elements."
I have defined several materials for my cross section. SHAPE-THIN calculates strange cross-section values.,"For profiles with several materials, SHAPE-THIN determines the ideal cross-section parameters and cross-section profiles. The reference is made to the reference material that is stored in the Calculation parameters dialog, Global calculation parameters tab. So the area of the individual materials is calculated withn = Ei / Eref converted to the area of the reference material."
What are the limits of the calculation core of RFEM?,"The following values represent the upper bounds in the data structure of RFEM:99999 structure data (objects of each category, ie nodes, lines, surfaces, etc.)99999 Load data (objects of each load type per load case)9999 load cases9999 load combinations (the sum of nonlinearly calculated load cases and load combinations must not be greater than 9999)9999 result combinations Please note that the limits for working effectively with RFEM are lower and also depend on the hardware."
Is it possible to export data from RFEM to RSTAB?,"An RFEM file can be read into RSTAB by renaming the file extension *.rf5 to *.rs8. However, all module entries and printout logs are deleted. It should also be noted that only beam structures are transferred to RSTAB; Area elements are deleted."
How can I rotate a profile 90° in 2D mode so I can load it around the weak axis? An error message appears when trying to rotate the profile.,"When you enter models in two-dimensional space, only rotation angles of the profiles of 0° and 180° are allowed. The direction of the local axis system in the member (xyz) is clearly regulated and for 2D models only the member section sizes My and Vz are calculated. The strong axis of the cross-section (y-axis) is always aligned in the direction of the global y-axis in two-dimensional space, the weak axis (z-axis) is not taken into account at all (assumed to be completely immovable). If cross-section rotations were now permitted, double bending could occur, since only loads in the XZ plane can be defined in 2D space. The resulting Vy, T and Mz components would then remain unconsidered. For this reason, only those cross-section rotations are permissible where the local z-axis of the cross-section points to the XZ plane.Finally, we recommend entering a 3D model in which any cross-section rotations are permissible are."
The output of the top and bottom reinforcement appears to be reversed in the graphic.,"Background: Each surface has a local coordinate system (x,y,z) in RFEM. The coordinates x and y are in the surface, z is perpendicular to the surface.The top and bottom of a surface is determined by the direction of the z-axis. The direction that the local z-axis is pointing is the bottom of a face. Normally this local z-axis points down. However, depending on the definition direction of the boundary lines and the order in which the lines were clicked, it may also be possible that the local z-axis points up.But this can be easily corrected. First, please display the local area coordinate systems. To do this, proceed as follows:Activate the Show navigator on the left side of the screen. This is done through the second tab at the bottom of the navigator. All display properties can be set here in a tree structure.Open the ""Model"" → ""Surfaces"" branch and activate the check box in front of the ""Surface axis systems x,y,z"" entry. p>The bottom reinforcement is on the side of the slab where the z-direction is positive.To reverse the direction of the local z-axis, now right-click on the relevant surface and select the entry ""Reverse local axis system"" in the context menu."
How to update graphics card driver and where to find updated graphics card driver?,"You can find the latest drivers for graphics cards on the websites of the graphics card manufacturers.Please note that the graphics card drivers must match the operating system.

My model is braced with tension rods. The calculation aborts with an instability message. How can I finish the calculation?,"A calculation abort due to an unstable system can have various reasons. There can be a 'real' instability due to an overload of the system, but instability effects can also arise due to failing members.In the calculation parameters, the non-linearity ""Members due to the member type"" can be deactivated on a trial basis. If the calculation is then possible without an error message, the problem is probably due to the failing tension members. With the option ""Failing members are removed one after the other in the respective iterations "" in the dialog Global calculation parameters the complete failure of the tension rods can be prevented. In most cases this already provides a remedy. The number of possible iterations should be specified sufficiently large. Alternatively, you can pre-tension the tension rods to prevent them from failing."
use RSIMP to create imperfections based on a buckling figure from RSBUCK. After generating I only get values for the skew. Why are all precambers zero?,"The values of the precambers are not output because the ordinate size of the buckling figure is probably so small that they are not taken into account with the set tolerance.In the Details dialog you can specify the ""Tolerance for member imperfections"", ie from which ordinate value of the buckling figure or deformation the imperfection should be generated."
Can you also plot from RSTAB and RFEM?,"Yes. This is on the one hand as a direct plot on a network plotter or on a local plotter, provided this plotter is installed as a Windows printer. Another possibility would be to plot to a file.Print plot directlySelect the graphic to be plotted and then go to the pressure symbol in RSTAB or RFEM. The following settings must be made in the Graphic printout dialog:Print immediately Graphic scale: Full windowGraphic image size: Over entire Page height Options tab: All coloredAfter OK, the print dialog appears in which you can select the installed plotter. The sheet size must then be specified in the properties of this driver.Plot to fileTo do this, check the above print dialog box in which you specify the printer , the Print to file checkbox. A *.prn file is created. If you then rename this file to an *.hgl file in Explorer, it can be read by an image processing program and transferred to the plotter."
"In a load case, compressive forces arise in the rope. How can this be explained?","Compression forces in cables or tension members can be output if the number of iterations for the calculation was not sufficient and convergence has therefore not yet been reached. You can set the number of iterations in the calculation parameters in the Global calculation parameters tab. For the Maximum number of iterations the default value is 100. However, this does not mean that all iterations are carried out. Depending on the system, the calculation usually converges much earlier.Also check the settings for reactivation of the failing members. If the option ""Failing bars are assigned very little stiffness"" is activated, small compressive forces can occur.If this is not justifiable, the option ""Failing bars are removed individually in the respective iterations one after the other"" can also be activated. be used. However, care should be taken to ensure a sufficient maximum number of iterations (see above)."

"I want to calculate a steel roof structure. The rafter components and purlins cross at the connection points at different heights.Is there a modeling option (without introducing an intermediate bar) so that the rafter only transmits vertical and shear forces, but no moments? The rafter and purlin rods should each cross the connection point in a rigid manner, and the purlin should not suffer any torsion.","In RSTAB and RFEM you can define a so-called scissor hinge for this. Crossings of members are thus possible without influencing their moment, shear force or normal force curves.Create a new member end hinge and select the reference system Global. Then activate the scissor joint options and define the released axes.As shown in the example, you can define the rafters as continuous and rigid. The crossing purlins are then to be provided with the scissor joint at the joint nodes."
"In a rope construction with pre-tension, the bearing forces are smaller than the pre-tension force. I examined two systems: example 1 is defined with a straight rope, while the rope of example 2 has a stitch. Why are there discernible differences here too?","The ""Prestress"" load is treated by the program like a member load as an external load and affects the entire system. It 'flows' into the system, so to speak, and accordingly generates deformations and bearing reactions. The prestress is converted into a change in length. Which axial force remains after the calculation depends on the deformation restraint of the member: If the stiffness of the connected system is soft, little or no prestress remains, but deformation does exist. The prestress can thus be compared to a change in temperature. One expresses the situation with a force and one with a temperature. In example 2, the prestressing force is almost completely converted into a deformation, which results in much lower normal forces and thus also lower support forces."
"Can cantilevers be dimensioned with BGDK? If so, on which method is the calculation based?","When dimensioning crane arms, determining the ideal lateral-torsional buckling moment MKi is crucial. This can be determined for monosymmetric I-profiles according to the article by Lohse (BGDK manual, chapter 2.4.4). However, rotation restraints and bound rotation axes are not taken into account."
Why are there differences in the calculation of the critical lateral-torsional buckling moment MKi according to DIN 18800 and Eurocode 3?,"The calculation of MKi is basically based on the same formulas. Nevertheless, there is a big difference:DIN 18800-2 simplifies the coefficient of the load application point C2 and sets it at a flat rate of 0.5. Eurocode 3 captures this coefficient more precisely. Depending on the load, C2 can be between 0.41 and 1.562.If you place the load application point in the center of gravity (assuming a doubly symmetrical profile), then according to DIN 18800 and EC 3 identical MKi values."
"In the RF-/STEEL EC3 add-on module, can the input data such as buckling lengths of several members or continuous members be edited at the same time?","Simultaneous editing of the input data of members and continuous members is possible in masks 1.4 to 1.13. To do this, activate the check box ""Assign input to members no."" in the lower area of the mask. and then specify the members with the same properties. The subsequently defined values are automatically applied to the selected members."
Why do the zeta coefficients used in BGDK differ from the coefficients from the literature?,"The coefficient ζ for considering the compressive force distribution in the chord is a correction factor to determine the critical lateral-torsional buckling moment MKi for certain boundary conditions and loads.In RF-/ BGDK, this correction factor ζ always refers to the maximum absolute bending moment of the equivalent member. The references in the literature often give the coefficient ζ in relation to the center of the equivalent member (see also RF-/LTB manual).In RF-/LTB there is also the option of specifying the zeta coefficient manually: In the Determination type M-Ki section, select the option ""Assign individual LF/LK""."
Do you also offer student versions of the RSTAB and RFEM programs?,"If you send us a valid certificate of enrollment, our software can be borrowed for a period of one year. The period of use can be extended by another year, whereby a new certificate of enrollment must be submitted. "
"How can I subsequently change the name and designation of my model? How do I get back to the ""Basic information"" dialog?","You can call up the basic information with the ""Edit"" → ""Model data"" → ""Basic information"" menu. Alternatively, click Right-click on ""Model data"" in the data navigator and select ""General data"" in the context menu. In the dialog you can then select the Change the name or the model type (planar, spatial).You can change the model name in Windows Explorer or in the project manager. The latter is accessible via the ""File"" → ""Project Manager"" menu or the corresponding button.Then select the model and choose the ""Model"" → ""Properties"" menu.

What does the red pin in the printout report navigator mean?,"The red pin in the navigator of the printout report means that a new page begins from this chapter.You can define a page break in the printout report by selecting the desired position with a right-click and ""With new Start page"" in the context menu."
"I installed the Dlubal applications including additional modules as an administrator. The Dlubal applications run without problems in this account. However, if I log in as a user for normal operation of my computer, I can no longer access the Dlubal applications.","The Dlubal applications RSTAB, RFEM, SHAPE-THIN etc. must be installed with administrator rights. It is advisable to start the software with administrator rights the first time. If no error messages are displayed, the rights to run the Dlubal applications can also be assigned to the users. User rights can only be assigned by the administrator.Rights for foldersA user of the Dlubal applications needs read and write rights for the following folders:Dlubal program folder RSTAB 8.xx, RFEM 5.xx, SHAPE-THIN 8.xx, RX-TIMBER 2.xx etc. By default, these are located in the directory C:\Programs\Dlubal (or for DICKQ C:\Programs (x86)\Dlubal).Dlubal master data folder General Data.

"In the ""Edit member"" dialog, there is the ""Effective lengths"" tab. How does a changed buckling length factor or the option ""Check exceeding the critical buckling load during calculation"" affect the calculation in RFEM?","The buckling length values that you can adjust in the ""buckling lengths"" tab have no effect on the determination of internal forces in RFEM or RSTAB. These values are defaults for add-on modules that perform a stability analysis, such as RF-/STEEL EC3 or RF-/TIMBER Pro. It is only there that these values come into play.The ""Check if the critical buckling load is exceeded during calculation"" checkbox, on the other hand, has an influence on the calculation: If the critical load of the member is reached, the member fails. The program then issues an instability message."
Is there a module for automatically generating action combinations?,"In RSTAB and RFEM, not only the manual definition of load and result combinations is possible. The combinations can also be generated automatically according to the requirements of German and international standards. To do this, the ""Generate combinations automatically"" option must be activated in the general data dialog of the model and the standard must be specified. The Assign load cases to standard-compliant actions. The program then automatically forms all load or result combinations that come into question according to the selected standard.Often not all generated load or result combinations need to be taken into account. They can therefore be reduced before the calculation (automatically or manually), so that the calculation time is reduced. "
"When opening the project manager, the message appears: ""Project directory incorrect! The directory X of project Y cannot be found!""","The message means that a linked project folder cannot be found. For example, if the folder was renamed or moved after the project was created. If the directory path is no longer correct, the project folder is displayed transparently. If you no longer need the project, you can use the [Disconnect ] remove from management. However, if you continue to use the project, you should close the dialog with the [Pass] or [Pass all] button (if there are several incorrect folders).Using the ""Link to file folder"" command in the project manager menu ""Project"" you can reintegrate the folder as a project into the administration of the project manager. Use the [Browse] button to set the file folder and specify the project name. You can also create a new project in the project manager menu and assign the new path to it."
Problems arise when importing a file such as a DXF file. An error message appears or the file created afterwards is empty. How can the problem be solved?,"For a successful import, the main program RSTAB or RFEM must be registered in Windows. If there are problems, you can also register manually.

The inclination according to DIN 18800 is set at the value 1/φ0 = 300. But I would have expected 200 as a starting value for one-piece rods. How can this be explained?,"When determining the misalignment, the verification procedure must also be taken into account in RSIMP/RF-IMP. In mask 1.2 you can specify the type of definition in column B by clicking in the cell.According to El. (201) only 2/3 of the values need to be applied when using the elastic-elastic design method .If, on the other hand, you set DIN 18800 EP as the definition type, 1/200 is used for calculation and you get the expected value."
I have problems with the definition of equivalent imperfections in RSTAB/RFEM. What should I watch out for?,"The following principles apply when entering imperfections:The members must have the same member rotation.When entering imperfections, the direction refers to the local ones Axes y and z. e.g. in the case of asymmetrical cross-sections, a reference to the main axes u and v is also possible.The position and orientation of the imperfection can be influenced by the sign of the imperfection size.It is helpful to display the local member axis systems. To do this, click on a bar with the right mouse button. You can activate the display of the member axis systems in the context menu."
"What does the term ""group"" mean when defining a new result combination?","In the ""Group"" column you can see how the individual load cases are grouped together and thus taken into account in the combination criterion. For example, load cases 3 to 6 are assigned to group 1. The load cases 14 and 15 belong to group 2. You can also imagine brackets around these groups: 1.35*LF1/s + 1.5*LF2 + (1.5*LF3 or up to LF6) + (1.5*LF14 or 1.5* LF15)The group numbers make it easier to understand the combination - especially in the case of combinations with several AND/OR links."
Can I also transfer the loads when copying systems?,"To copy including loads, proceed as follows:Select the objects to be copied (nodes, members, etc.).Call the menu Edit the function Move, Copy (alternatively click on the selected objects with the right mouse button and context menu function Move, Copy).Put Under ""Detailed Settings"" you specify that the copying should take place including the debit. In this way, the loads of all load cases are also copied."
Why aren't the maximum stresses determined in STEEL when calculating a result combination?,"In the case of biaxial stress, it can happen that the combined internal forces do not lead to the maximum stresses. Therefore, the option ""Calculate stresses of individual load cases from EK and then superimpose them according to EK criterion"" is the default. Please check in the Details dialog whether this calculation type is specified.You can find more information on the stresses of result combinations in the RF-/STEEL manual."
How can I define a plane calculation for a double-hinged frame so that I don't have to define supports in the Y-direction?,"You can specify the model type 2D - in XZ (flat) or 3D (spatial) in the Basic information.The basic data of a model can be found under the menu item ""Edit → Model data → Basic data"". Alternatively, right-click in the data navigator ""Model data"" and select ""Basic data"" in the context menu. The model type can also be adjusted later."
"When saving, the following message appears: ""The model '1' should be saved in the directory 'C:\Program Files\TEST'. However, this directory is not linked to a project. Do you want to create a new project for this directory?"" What does that mean?","There is still no link to an RFEM or RSTAB project for the directory in which the model is to be saved. If you answered the question ""Do you want to create a new project for this directory? "" with No, the model will be saved in this directory. However, it is then not assigned to any project. One of the consequences of this is that no project name is specified in the printout report. Models should therefore be assigned to a project. The project itself is only a link to a directory. The project manager offers an overview of all projects. Therefore, answer Yes. You will then be prompted in a dialog to enter a project name for the specified directory. If you want to suppress the message completely, you can call up a dialog with the corresponding setting option via the project manager menu ""Edit → Program options"". "
Can I edit an RSTAB model in RFEM?,"The RSTAB systems can be transferred to RFEM: In the project manager, select the ""Open with"" option in the context menu of the model."

Furthermore, different definitions are possible for the individual additional modules as well as for the main programs. "
"Does SUPER-EK only superimpose internal forces from models that have already been saved, or also from currently open models that have not yet been saved?",The calculation of the super combination does not require that the results of the other open models are available. The required load cases or combinations are automatically calculated. The models contained in the SUPER-EK should also be open during the calculation. 
"I have defined a pre-deformation in RSTAB. If FE-LTB takes over the loads, why not the imperfection too?","According to EN 1993-1-1 and DIN 18800 Part 2, geometric substitute imperfections must be specified for calculations based on the second-order theory in order to include geometric and structural imperfections. This pre-deformation should be applied affine to the lowest buckling or lateral-torsional buckling eigenmode. In RF-/FE-LTB the eigenmode belonging to the smallest eigenvalue is therefore calculated (prior eigenvalue analysis) and selected as the pre-deformation figur. The imperfection approach is then carried out by scaling the eigenmode by the user.Thus, the pre-deformation in RF-/FE-LTB is based on the eigenmode. The imperfections defined in RFEM/RSTAB are irrelevant and are therefore not adopted."
"I did not manage to make the pre-deformations visible in rendering mode in FE-LTB. I see either the undeformed system or the stress profile, but never the pre-deformation!","You can make the pre-deformations visible in the rendering mode after you have pressed the [Select imperfection] button in the 2.3 Imperfections window.The RSTAB work window appears. In the navigator you can see which mode shape is currently being displayed. You can use the selection fields to check the first 10 eigenforms graphically.You can also view the individual eigenforms in rendering mode and even animate them. The same function as in RSTAB is responsible for the rendering. After the calculation in FE-LTB, you can use the [Graphic] button to view the stress curve, the ratios, internal forces, deformations and the eigenmode used in the rendering."
"When I try to select the imperfections, the message ""Results of eigenmodes not found"" appears. Why is that?","The message means that the system is numerically unstable. Such instability is often due to incorrect support conditions or release definitions in RF-/FE-LTB. Therefore, check the degrees of freedom of the continuous member in windows 1.4 Nodal Support and 1.7 Member Hinges.Background: The critical load factor is first determined both when selecting the imperfections and in the actual calculation. The critical load of the system is determined from this. This is characterized by the fact that either the determinant of the stiffness matrix becomes zero or very large deformations occur in the calculation with small increases in load."
"I have idealized a haunch through the start and end cross section (calculated with SHAPE-THIN) and calculated the frames. During the stress calculation in STEEL, the error message ""Tapped bar contains incompatible cross-sections"" appears. Where is the mistake?","This message appears when the two profiles of the haunch have a different number of stress points.The stresses in STEEL are determined with the moments of inertia and the distances to the stress points. If the start and end sections of a haunch have a different number and location of stress points, the program cannot interpolate the intermediate values. In the rendering mode, no haunch is then displayed, but only the two profiles at the beginning and end. Both meet in the middle of the bar.You can see the profile stress points under the details of the cross-section. The [Details of stress points] button hides a table with the exact values for the stress points (number, location, etc.).So you have to create the same number of stress points to solve the problem. You can achieve this, for example, by creating the profile at the end of the haunch as a copy of the start profile and adjusting the height. But the basic form must be retained. It may therefore be necessary to also model a minimal reinforcement.You could also create the haunch cross-sections with the profiles of the RSTAB library: For this purpose, the ""Half profiles reinforced below IVU"" are available under the welded profiles ."
"I have created several printout report templates. Now I would like to change the names of the patterns, but not the name of the printout report that was created with them.",Call up the printout report and open the menu Settings → Printout report template → Select. You can use the [Rename selected printout report template] button to assign a new name to the template.You can change the name of the printout report created with this using the Printout report menu File → Rename.
How can I change the printhead?,"In RSTAB and RFEM you can select and change the report header as follows: Open the printout report, in the menu ""Settings → Printhead"" you can now enter changes and then [Set the printhead as default]. You can also use the [Printhead library] button to define a new report header and then read it in from the library using the Printhead presetting. So you can always use the right print head for different projects."
Why is there no total displacement in the table for result combinations?,"The different output of the member and node deformations for load cases and result combinations has the following reason:With a LC, the total member displacement u is made up of the individual displacements ux, uy and uz.With an EK, on the other hand, it is possible that the individual shifts ux, uy and uz come from different load cases. Thus, the total displacement cannot be calculated correctly. The individual maximum deformations would have to be listed separately, indicating which load cases lead to these results and which lead to the max and min values."
"In the case of the support forces of a result combination, the maximum component is equal to zero. That cant be true. The minimum power is fine.","The maximum bearing force of the EK is equal to zero because the load combinations contained in the combination are defined as variable (possibly) acting. Since all bearing forces of these LKs have negative signs, the result in the EK is only a negative value. The other value is zero because theoretically no LK can act (since 'possibly'): Zero is then a maximum greater than any negative value.You should use the load combinations contained in the EK for the solution define as permanent acting:EK1 = LK1/permanent or LK2/permanent or LK3/permanentThe load combinations 1 to 3 are compared with this. The most unfavorable value provides the minimum and maximum result."
Which limits apply in RSTAB regarding the structural elements?,"The calculation core of the RSTAB family currently has the following upper limits:999 999 structure data (objects of each category, ie nodes, members, etc.)999 999 load data ( objects of each load type per load case)9 999 load cases9 999 load combinations9 999 result combinations9 999 super combinations "
The calculation of the critical load factor according to the second-order theory in RSTAB returns a value that deviates significantly from the RSBUCK result.,"Check whether RSTAB and RSBUCK have the same settings for considering the relieving effect of tensile forces. RSTAB determines the critical load factor using a non-linear calculation method: The load is gradually increased by the value of the load factor increase Δk increased until the system becomes unstable. RSBUCK, on the other hand, performs a linear eigenvalue analysis. Non-linear elements such as failing members or supports can therefore have different effects in RSTAB and RSBUCK."
"I overlay two load cases in a result combination with the criterion 'or'. However, the result graphic of the result combination shows smaller deformations than those of the load cases contained.Furthermore, I get a positive and a negative maximum value for the EK, although the individual load cases deliver positive deformation values.","In the result combination, RSTAB superimposes the (orthogonal) components ux, uy and uz of the individual load cases and forms the total deformation u. According to the definition of the coordinate system, the orthogonal components of the load cases can be positive or negative. It is therefore only a display problem, since the direction of the deformations u shown in the graphic is not clearly defined.Determining the EK extreme values leads to two values: maximum and minimum. The geometric addition of the minimum and the maximum value provides the correct deformation value of the result combination. The correct value is shown in the results table."
Which graphics card does Dlubal recommend?,"For working with RFEM and RSTAB, a graphics card is recommended that accelerates the OpenGL functions on the hardware side. This is the case with all current graphics cards.We recommend cards that are equipped with an NVIDIA graphics processor. However, RFEM and RSTAB do not necessarily require high-performance CAD graphics cards (NVIDIA Quadro...).It is important that the graphics card drivers are always kept up to date.The drivers The drivers of the so-called mainstream graphics cards (NVIDIA GeForce...) are better adapted to a wide variety of computer configurations, which is why significantly fewer problems occur here than with CAD cards. We advise against graphics solutions that are integrated into the chipset or main processor (Intel HD xxxx, G xx, Qxx).Notebooks are often equipped with two graphics chips - a power-saving Intel HD processor-integrated chip and an additional more powerful graphics chip from NVIDIA or AMD. In this case, it should be ensured that RFEM and RSTAB use the powerful graphics chip."
"Some model and loading elements are not shown in the graphic, although they are present in the navigator and tables.","Check in the Project Navigator - Show that all parts under ""Model"" are activated.The visibilities are managed in the Views navigator. With the [Clear visibility mode] button you restore the display of all objects."
"I installed RFEM without any problems. However, the full version does not start when the program is called up. A dialog appears in which the authorization file can be read in or the test license can be started. The dongle lights up and should work. What can I do?","You probably did not install with administrator rights, or you did not use the current authorization file. In the first case, it is necessary to have write access to the file folders of the Dlubal programs in Windows Explorer released for the corresponding user. Then read in the authorization file AUTHOR.INI again via the RFEM menu ""Help → Authorization"". In the second case, it is usually sufficient to read in the current authorization file that you can be downloaded from the Dubal homepage. To do this, enter your user data above under My Account. You can then import the AUTHOR.INI as described above."
What does the mrad unit mean for twisting?,"Rad was selected for the unit of rotation angle in RSTAB.The results of the node deformation in Table 3.6, for example, are output in mrad, i.e. milli-radians.For the conversion of the The following general formulas apply to angular dimensions, whereby the radian unit is to be used here:From radians to degrees: alpha = (180° / pi) * xFrom degrees - to radians: x = (pi / 180°) * alphaThe following formula applies to direct conversion with the mrad unit used in RSTAB for radians:From radians in degrees: alpha = (180° / (pi * 1000) ) * xAttention: mrad!"
"There are several crossing bars in my system, but they are not yet connected to each other. What is the easiest way to create a node at the connection point?","The function you are looking for is ""connect lines/rods"". You can call this up via the menu item Edit → Model data → Members → ""Connect lines/members"" or via the corresponding button in the toolbar. After activating the command, a window is opened over the connection point. A node is created between the crossing bars."
"After completing the project, I just want to back up the input data (without results). Is there an archiving option for this?","In the project manager, you have the option of saving selected models or an entire project in a compressed archive file.Select the model or project that you want to archive. Then call up the menu ""Archive data → Archive"".In the following dialog you can specify whether the results and printout reports should also be archived.After input the desired file name and specifying the path, start archiving with OK."
"Which solver method should I use, direct or iterative?","Which method leads to faster results depends on the complexity of the model and the available main memory (RAM):For small and medium-sized systems, the direct method More effective.In very large systems, the iterative method produces results faster.As soon as the matrices are no longer stored in main memory using the direct method can, Windows begins to swap out parts of the main memory to the hard disk. This can be recognized by strong hard disk activity and low processor utilization in the task manager. This memory problem can be avoided by switching to the iterative ICG (Incomplete Conjugate Gradient) calculation method."
The Dlubal applications are to be installed on a new computer. The installation aborts because the dongle driver cannot be installed correctly. What should I do?,"Administrator rights are required for a successful installation. Without sufficient rights it can happen that the installation of the dongle driver is aborted. Another reason for an installation abort can be the virus scanner if it is set to ""active"". It is often sufficient to adjust the filter settings of the virus scanner or to temporarily disable the virus scanner."
Authorization at program start fails. The dongle appears to be defective. What can I do?,"You can download a program from the following link with which you can read out both the dongles connected to the computer and the network dongles:http://download.dlubal.com/?file=KeyDump.zipUnzip the KeyDump.zip file and run the KeyDump.exe file in the target folder. You should then see the dongle under ""License Information"" in the diagnostic program.

Remove third-party dongles.Administrator rights are required for successful installation."
How do I create a splice connection in the Steel Joints add-on?,"A splice connection using end plates can be easily created using the “Plate to Plate” template from the ''Components'' library.

 

For a splice joint without end plates, the configuration can be created manually by adding individual components. 

 

The configuration includes the following components. Each component can be easily deleted or copied by right-clicking on the component.

* Plate (2 outer flange plates, 4 inner flange plates, 2 web plates)
* Fasteners (4 sets to connect 4 inner flange plates, 1 set to connect web plate)
* Auxiliary Plane (2 planes)
* Member Cut (2 cuts with the type of cut “By auxiliary plane”)

It is required that a small gap is created using “Member Cut” and “Auxiliary Plane”. The gap is divided between the two members (that is, 1/16” gap is applied as 1/32” displacement to each member).

Alternatively, a sample model “AISC Splice Connection” can be downloaded and saved as a user-defined template.

How can I edit multiple models in one script using Python?,"If your project requires editing multiple models, there are two options to choose:
* If you have multiple operations to do in one model and then switch to another, you can do it easily by calling Model() before switching it. This is executed in one session, that is, as fast as possible.

Material(2,'S235')

model2 = Model(True, 'TestModel2')
Material(3,'S275')

Model(False, 'TestModel1')
Material(4,'S235')

Model(False, 'TestModel2')
Material(5,'S275')

Does RFEM check the applicability limits of AISI Table B4.11?,"The safety factor Ω and resistance factor Φ used in Chapters E through H are only appropriate for sections that comply with the limitations in Table B4.11. For all other sections that exceed any of the limits, higher safety factors Ω or lower resistance factors Φ are applied according to section A1.2(C). In RFEM, this limitation is checked by default. The user has the option to deactivate this check in the ""Strength Configuration"". 

 

Shapes that can be checked in RFEM include C, Z, L, I (double back-to-back C), hat, rectangular, and round HSS. The 8ZS2.75 x 105 section meets the applicability limits.

 

For general/complex sections, such as the sigma section used in Example III 14 of AISI D100 17, the more conservative factors are automatically applied. As a result, Φc = 0.80 is used in the RFEM design checks. However, the manual calculation shows that the sigma section actually meets the applicability limits and Φc = 0.85 can be used instead.

 "
Can I design user-defined (parametric) sections according to AISI S100 or CSA S136?,"A custom section can be created using one of the “Thin-Walled” sections available in the library. For other sections that do not meet any of the 14 available cold-formed shapes, the sections can be created and imported from the stand-alone program RSECTION.

 

Parametric (custom) sections with the manufacturing type “Cold formed” can be designed according to AISI S100 or CSA S136.

 "
Which standardized sections are valid for AISI cold-formed steel design in RFEM 6?,"Channels, hats, angles, and Z sections from AISI D100-17 standard can be designed according to AISI S100 in the Steel Design Add-on.

 

Additionally, all rectangular and round HSS AISC shapes can also be designed per AISI S100. This option is set under the ''Strength Configuration'' for Steel Design.

 "
Can I exclude bolt threads from the shear planes according to AISC 360-16 in the Steel Joints Add-on?,"By default, the ''Shear plane in thread'' option is activated and the lower strength according to the selected design standard is considered for the bolt shear check.

In AISC, the bolt nominal shear strengths are listed in Table J3.2. As an example, Group A (for example, A325) bolt has a nominal shear strength of 54 ksi (372 MPa) when the threads are '''not''' excluded from the shear planes. To use the higher strength of 68 ksi (469 MPa), the option can be unchecked to exclude threads from the shear planes.

How does RFEM 6 classify a member as a column when designing reinforced concrete according to the ACI 318 and CSA A23.3?,"RFEM 6 classifies a member as a column when designing reinforced concrete according to the ACI 318 and CSA A23.3 based on specific criteria that must be met. In particular, RFEM 6 considers a member to be a column when it has a compression force Pu greater than 0.1 times the product of the concrete compressive strength (fc) and the gross cross-sectional area (Ag). Additionally, the ratio of the eccentricity (e = M/Pu) to the statical depth (e/d) must be less than the value of 3.5. These criteria must be met for at least 50% of the member length for it to be classified as a column and designed as such according to the ACI 318 and CSA A23.3."
Is RFEM 6 / RSTAB 9 able to run on a virtual machine?,"RFEM 6 / RSTAB 9 requires a recent version of OpenGL to run efficiently. Ideally, a virtual machine (VM) should have a high-performance graphics card such as NVIDIA. However, this is not required. An open-source implementation of OpenGL, such as Mesa, is sufficient, but the performance may decrease."
How can I define a scissor hinge in RFEM 6?,"During the creation of a new member hinge, it is required to specify a Global Coordinate System for the hinge, for the Scissor Hinge option to be available. After selecting the function, a new tab of options becomes available where you can define exactly in which directions the scissor hinge is supposed to act.

In the example shown below, there are two substructures. 
The left model shows the behavior of a system where moments are transferred in a continuous direction between two elements with a scissor hinge defined.

The right model shows the behavior of a system where only one of the elements has a scissor hinge."
Where can I display or adjust the local axis systems in RFEM 6?,"It is possible to display local axis systems for lines, members, surfaces, and solids. The selection of the display is available in the Display tab of the Project Navigator, for example.

For surfaces, the X and Y axis fit in the plane of the surface, and the Z axis is perpendicular to it. The direction of the local Z axis for a surface is not dependent on the global direction of the Z axis.

For members, the X axis is located along the member by default, and the Y and Z axes are perpendicular to it. For most of the sections, the Z axis is located along the stronger axis of inertia of an element.

The local axis system can be reversed by using the option in the shortcut menu of the given element, or in the case of surfaces, with the element options of the specific axes."
Is it possible to adjust the background color in RFEM 6?,"The option to change the graphic settings in the program can be found in the menu: 
""Options - Display Properties"" 
Here is a window, where you can edit the display of all objects in the program.
In order to change the background color, please go to the tab: 
""General - Background"" 
Here, it is possible to change the color separately for the model view and the report view. It is also possible to define a color gradient for the background.
After applying the changes, the new background will be defined permanently, until the next change.

Additionally, it is possible to load a preset of Dark or White Background."
"The model loads, supports, and so on, are scaled extremely large even if I set the scaling to the minimum. How can I decrease the size?","This can happen if you have a node that is very far away from the main structure. It is recommended that you set the view to ""Isometric"" and then this will zoom out on your model and give you an idea of where these stray elements are located.
 
 
You will need to delete these elements that are not attached to the structure or move them closer.
Note: Enlarged graphical issues can happen when importing a model from another format and the structure is extremely far away from the origin. The solution to this is to move the model as close as possible to the origin."
"How can I design my structure according to ASD strength design (such as AISC, ADM, NDS, and so on)?","To run the design check according to ASD, you can create a copy of the existing ASD Design situation.
 
Under the selected Design Add-on - Design Situations tab, you can then set up the table to look like the following where the LRFD is disabled and the two ASD Design Situations are set to ASD limit state as well as Serviceability limit state.
 "
Why are the support reaction orientations shown graphically opposite of what I expect based on the table result output?,"Support reactions available in the Navigator - Results tab will activate the support reactions graphically due to the applied static loads. These are the equal and opposite forces at the supports to resist the applied loads. All magnitudes are positive with the arrow indicating the reaction direction. 

However, in the table results Static Analysis - Results by Node - Support Forces tab, you'll notice that while the magnitudes are identical to the graphical display, the signage is opposite. This is due to the fact that the ""forces"" are given in this table directly vs. the ""reactions"" which are shown graphically as explained above. 

Users have the ability to turn on the table signage graphically under the Navigator - Results tab - Support Reactions - With Sign.

How can I model a rib element in RFEM 6?,"A rib element can easily be modeled in RFEM 6 by changing the Member Type from ""Beam"" to ""Rib"" in the drop-down
 

Then, once a section and material is assigned in the Section tab, a new tab called ""Rib"" can be used to change a multitude of parameters.

Under the ""Rib"" tab, the rib alignment can be chosen along with one or two surfaces the rib is integrated with. Then, segments can be created using percentage (default) or lengths under the Ordinates column. These two options can be swapped by using the ""Switch Relative/Absolute Ordinates"" or ""%"" button. Segments allow you to divide the member and use different parameters for each section. That length is referenced in the next list of parameters.

 

The first parameter is the Definition Type where you can choose if you would like to adjust a Segment, Member, or User-Defined. User-Defined allows you to enter a custom length for Lref/8. Choosing member sets Lref to the length of the member. Segment sets Lref to the length of the segment.

Then, the ""Width"" parameters can either be entered manually, or they can be determined by referencing the length or EC2. Here are their definitions:

bint: Represents the internal integration width of the surface.

beff: Represents the effective width used in the Concrete Design add-on. 

bmax: Represents the maximum possible value for bint and beff. 

If the equal sign ""="" button is selected, then beff will be set equal to bint.

How can I make sure RFEM 6 and RSTAB 9 are using the dedicated graphics card in my computer?,"To make sure RFEM 6 and RSTAB 9 are using the dedicated graphics card in a system, go to the following Windows setting. This will work for either Windows 10 or 11.

1. Go to Start and then Settings. 

2. Then, go to Display.


3. Next, scroll down to Graphics.

4. Search for RFEM 6 or RSTAB 9. If this is not detected, browse for it in the system.
 

5. Lastly, click on Options and select the desired GPU.
 

This should also be set in the subsequent graphics control panel whether you own an Nvidia or AMD GPU.

 "
What can I do to increase the performance when the model is very large?,"Generally, in order to optimize or minimize the time required for all processes in the case of large models, you should pay attention to various points. It might be helpful to:

* Use the wireframe model in the graphic instead of the solid model,
* Deactivate the display of tables and the navigator,
* Add our programs to the exceptions in the settings of your antivirus program,
* Have as few applications and RFEM 6/RSTAB 9 files as possible open at the same time,
* Upgrade your PC. For example, you can often achieve significant performance increase with an SSD memory. Your PC should also have sufficient RAM memory.

Furthermore, generated loads can also negatively affect the performance, as they are recalculated in the background after each work step. If there are many of them in the model, it can be useful sometimes to disconnect them. However, the big advantage of adjusting the loads automatically is if any changes are made to the model the loading will be adjusted automatically. 

It may also be helpful to save the RFEM 6/RSTAB 9 files locally, instead of in a network.

One possible cause of the slower reactions of the program may be missing user rights. If you are not working with the administrator account, it is necessary to have full access rights to various directories and subdirectories.

Furthermore, you should ensure that you are always working with the current version of RFEM 6/RSTAB 9."
"I am looking for a way to roll out RWIND using software deployment. Unfortunately, I cannot find an MSI file.","The RWIND installation program allows automated electronic software distribution, also known as a silent (unattended) installation. In the Silent mode, there is no need for a user to monitor the installation and provide input via dialog boxes. The Silent installation runs on its own, without any end-user intervention, which may be very useful when installing RWIND on a large number of computers, for example in a computer classroom.

'''The silent installation consists of two steps:'''

1. Recording parameters for the silent install. Run the setup with the -r parameter to select setup options and automatically record the InstallShield Silent Response File (Setup.iss).

2. Running the silent install (repeatedly). Once the Silent Response File is ready, you can run the setup with the -s parameter, which installs RWIND in the silent mode according to parameters stored in the Silent Response File.

'''Example:'''

Let's assume that you have downloaded RWIND installation program RWIND_2.02.2230.exe and saved it to N:\Tmp_RWIND directory on a shared network drive. You can then create two batch files for the silent install:

Batch file N:\Tmp_RWIND\Silent_Install_RWIND_Record.bat for recording of installation parameters with content:

""N:\Tmp_RWIND\RWIND_2.02.2230.exe"" /a /r /f1""N:\Tmp_RWIND\Setup.iss""

and batch file N:\Tmp_RWIND\Silent_Install_RWIND_Play.bat for the silent install with content:

""N:\Tmp_RWIND\RWIND_2.02.2230.exe"" /a /s /f1""N:\Tmp_RWIND\Setup.iss""

Run Silent_Install_RWIND_Record.bat from one of your computers and create the InstallShield Response File (Setup.iss) in N:\Tmp_RWIND directory. Note that you can also create/edit the response file manually in a text editor (Notepad.exe). After creating the Response file, you can run Silent_Install_RWIND_Play.bat on all other computers to install RWIND silently.

You can also download the batch files here 

RWIND_Silent_Install_Batchfiles.zip but remember that you have to modify them according to your real names and paths.

Note that these batch files require elevated privileges, that is, to run the batch file, click on the file by right mouse button and select ""Run as Administrator""."
What is the difference between RWIND 2 Basic vs. Pro?,"The most significant difference between the RWIND 2 Basic vs. Pro options is the simulation type. The Basic edition applies a steady-flow simulation. The Pro edition contains everything that is available in the Basic edition, but also provides new options and features including the transient flow simulation using a more advanced turbulence model (Spalart-Allmaras DDES).

For a full list of features compared in both versions, please refer to the RWIND 2 online manual RWIND Basic and RWIND Pro section with the link below."
The load distribution on my members looks different when using the Load Transfer surface vs. the Load Wizards. What is the reason?," 

The ''Load Transfer'' surface and ''Member Loads from Area Load'' (Load Wizards) use different approaches to distribute loads to the members. Therefore, they cannot be compared directly.

The ''Load Transfer'' surface divides the surface into stripes in a specific direction, then investigates the loads on each stripe separately. The stripe width can be adjusted by activating the ''Advanced distribution settings'' option. If necessary, a larger stripe width may be used to “smooth out” the high jumps that are shown graphically.

 

On the other hand, the ''Load Wizards'' use isotropic distribution, creates Voronoi cells, and investigates the load at each cell."
My beam has a continuous lateral support and therefore lateral torsional buckling (LTB) is not a concern. How do I define the effective length?,"In the ''Effective Length'' dialog box, you can simply uncheck the ""Lateral Torsional Buckling"" option to exclude this check in the design add-on.

 "
I received an error message “Surface of incompatible type... (Surface in upper plane of building story must be of ‘Load transfer’ type)” when running the calculation. What is the reason?," 

You have selected ""Rigid diaphragm"" as the story slab stiffness in the Building Stories. The ""Rigid Diaphragm"" is used to rigidly connect all components of a story in the floor plane with a rigid link. By doing so, the floor can no longer be defined with its real stiffness. 
 

Therefore, surfaces with the ""Load Transfer"" stiffness type must be used. It is not possible to create internal rigid links for surfaces with the stiffness type ""Standard"".

 "
Which Limit State Types are applicable for the AISC 341 seismic design?,"The Earthquake Limit State (with and without overstrength) only provides a result for members with an assigned ''Seismic Configuration''. 
The Strength Limit State is used to design all members, including the members that are not part of the seismic force-resisting system (SFRS). Therefore, both Earthquake and Strength Limit States are required. 
The Serviceability Limit State is also available. 
Notes: 
1) The web ductility check per Table D1.1 of AISC 341 16 (RFEM EQ 1100) is applicable to all load combinations, including non-seismic COs. Therefore, the Earthquake Limit State is also applied to Equations 1 to 5.
2) For the ''Combination Wizard'', the “Result Combinations” is required when using the response spectrum analysis."
My ASCE 7 generated seismic load combinations combine the X and Y directions in the same CO. How do I change this to independent directions only?,"RFEM default setting assumes the orthogonal combination of the X and Y directions. To apply the Independent Directional procedure, go to the ''Actions'' tab and change the action type from ''Simultaneously'' to ''Alternatively'' for Qe. 

 

Next, go to the ''Design Situations'' tab and select ''Edit Combination Wizard''. In the ''Standard Options'' tab, deactivate the “Include orthogonal combinations” option.

Case A: To apply the same factor in the X and Y directions, use the generic (no direction) overstrength factor Ωo.

Case B: To apply different factors in each direction, use the overstrength factors X and Y, Ωo,x and Ωo,y. The generic factor Ωo in the first row is not used.

2) Under the ''Load Cases'' tab, create a seismic load case with Qe as the ''Action Category''. Next, select the ''Additional Settings'' tab and pick the direction 
 

'''Note:''' When neither or both directions are activated under the '''same''' load case, the generic overstrength factor, Ωo is used. Create a '''separate''' load case to apply the individual factors, Ωo,x and Ωo,y. 

3) Under the ''Design Situations'' tab, select the applicable overstrength Design Situation Type. Both LRFD and ASD methods are available 
 

4) In the ''Load Combinations'' tab, verify that the correct factor(s) have been applied. Factors are also shown in the ''Result Combinations'' tab, if applicable. Click OK to exit 
 

5) The final step is to assign the applicable limit state type to the overstrength design situation. For members '''without''' assigned seismic configuration, select the ""Strength limit state"" (LRFD or ASD) as the ''Limit State Type''.

How do I define effective lengths when designing steel members in RFEM 6?,"There are two options when it comes to defining effective lengths in RFEM 6. First, edit the member and navigate to the ""Design Types"" Tab. Second, create a new effective lengths definition.

 

Third, set whether you would like to calculate the critical moment according to an Eigenvalue method or Chapter F. from the AISC. Fourth, navigate to the ""Nodal Supports and Effective Lengths"" tab. Within this tab there are two different methods that can be used.

Method 1: Nodal Supports

Referencing Member No. 1 in the attached model, for this column you can see a how the effective lengths for the Start, End, and Intermediate nodes are defined. First, click on the Select Member or Member Set and then select the member. This will activate the intermediate nodes along the member length in the table. Next, check whether the node can move in the y/z axis (weak/strong axis), rotate about its local x axis (torsion), and about its local z axis. 

 

Top and bottom flanges can also be restrained separately by fixing the y axis and by releasing (unchecking) the rotation about the local x axis restraint (torsion). 

 

Method 2: ""K"" Factors and Absolute Values

Referencing Member No. 5 in the attached model, the effective length factors can be used to define the unbraced length directly and/or apply the appropriate member end conditions. To adjust the unbraced lengths directly instead of utilizing the nodes on member (Method 1), the ""K"" factors can be entered manually in the table below. Or the ""Absolute Values"" can be entered by checking on the option ""Absolute Values"". Then the unbraced length itself can be entered manually instead. This method is best used when there are no intermediate node(s) currently present on the member.

 

"
Is there a way to generate nodes at intersections of lines without dividing the line in RFEM 6?,"There are two different options for doing this.

Option #1:
Right click on the line and use the ""Divide Line"" tool. Within this tool check on the option to ""Create ""On Line"" nodes without dividing line.""

 

Option #2: 
Manually draw a node and snap to the intersection point. 

 

Double click on this node to edit it and change it to an ""On Line"" node type. 

 

"
How do I define a member as a cantilever and not as supported at both ends for serviceability or deflection design?,"All members when using the Design Add-ons for serviceability checks are considered supported at the end nodes by default. If the member is instead a cantilever or includes an internal support for a combination of both a cantilever and supported at both ends member type, a new Design Support should be defined under the member details.

The Design Support option can be found under the member dialog box under Design Supports & Deflection tab. Supports can be added to any nodes detected along the member length such as the member start, member end, or internal nodes.

 

Under the New Design Support dialog box, you can set the type of support from the drop-down including general, concrete, or timber. The ""general"" will give the program guidance on the deflection member type and which limiting deflection ratio to reference from the Serviceability Configurations whether cantilever (e.g., L/180) or supported on both ends (e.g., L/360). The alternative types ""concrete"" and ""timber"" will also influence the deflection design, but have additional strength design options incorporated such as moment and shear internal force modification for concrete design and a stress perpendicular to grain check for timber design.

For additional detailed information on this new setting in RFEM 6 including a ""timber"" type design support, refer to the webinar listed below under Links at time 51:05.

This option will allow the user to set the bar size diameter directly rather than selecting a default bar size from the drop-down. "
Can the RFEM 6 Concrete Design add-on automatically design member and surface reinforcement?,"In the current state of RFEM 6, the user must manually define the shear and longitudinal reinforcement for both members and surfaces. This is considered the ""Provided Reinforcement"" within the Concrete Design add-on. The add-on calculation will then determine the ""Required Reinforcement"" needed from the analysis and further output the ""Not Covered Reinforcement"". The user must manually apply additional reinforcement if the ""Required Reinforcement"" is not met. It is planned for the future to have an automatic design of the member and surface reinforcement rather than only the manual input option. "

A separate email will be sent to you with your RFEM 6 login data for access to the program without limitations for 90 days. Please note, only one trial version will be provided to each company. You will not have the ability for multiple users under the same account to download multiple trial versions. Once the trial version is requested from any user under the same company account, the ability to request a second trial version for any other user will not be possible. All users, however, can create their own login credentials and access the company-wide trial version over 90-days as long as someone else is not currently in the program."
Can I open RFEM 5 models in RFEM 6 without losing any data? ,"An RFEM 5 model can be opened in RFEM 6 which will transfer most of the geometry, materials, sections, and loading. There may be an exception to some elements for example, material databases which may have been updated or nonlinear support definitions that now have a different definition layout to name a couple. After selecting the file for import, a list of nontransferable elements will be presented before the model is opened in RFEM 6.Add-on module data will not be available due to the program design changes between generations. "
Does the RFEM 6 user interface look the same as RFEM 5? ,"There are many similarities between the RFEM 5 the RFEM 6 user interface and in general, the modeling workflow including drawing members, surfaces, nodes, etc. will be familiar as well as the program GUI. However, the biggest change will include the concept that design is integrated directly in the main program rather than a separate add-on module dialog box. Design parameters are assigned to members, surfaces, and solids directly when initially modeling the element. The modifications to the modeling workflow will be a more efficient and intuitive approach than previous versions. Download a free 90-day trial version for RFEM 6 to explore the updated user interface today."
What new features are offered in RFEM 6? ,"RFEM 6 was completely written in a modern framework programming language (C++ with Qt). Graphics and the overall GUI is greatly improved including a quicker and more reliable printout report. Cloud-based licensing is also used allowing multiple users within the same company to share licenses on different computers.Perhaps the biggest change between program generations is the add-on modules are now integrated directly in the main program renamed as “add-ons”. This means that information such as unbraced lengths, reinforcement layout, etc. will be defined directly in RFEM 6. Design ratios will then be provided within the main program rather than what used to be a separate add-on module dialog box. Complete design equations are now provided for each standard and material so users have a clear and traceable understanding of the results. Although some new program concepts will require a different workflow for those used to RFEM 5, we’re confident these changes will lead to more efficient and complete model designs. Check out a more complete list of new features with the link listed below. "
Are all features that I'm using now in RFEM 5 available in the first release of RFEM 6?,"RFEM 6 will be released in phases. The initial phase will not include all capabilities that RFEM 5 currently has, such as CLT design (RF LAMINATE), glass design (RF GLASS), some BIM integration (i.e. Revit), and a handful of other features. Therefore, we will continue to fully support RFEM 5 until RFEM 6 during this ~2-year overlap period. Customers who rely heavily on CLT design, may choose to not upgrade to RFEM 6 until a later time or can upgrade and have concurrent access to both RFEM 5 and RFEM 6."
"Can add-ons be shared with the main RFEM 6 program like it is now with an RFEM 5 network license (for example, (2) seats of RFEM share (1) seat of RF‑TIMBER AWC)?","Because we will no longer offer a network vs. standalone option in RFEM 6 as this generation is entirely cloud-based licensing, the add-ons can no longer be shared between the main RFEM 6 program.As an example, you can purchase one RFEM 6 license with the timber design add-on (design of timber members according to NDS, CSA, EC5, and so on) and choose to purchase a second RFEM 6 license with the steel design add-on (design of steel members according to AISC, CSA S16, EC3, and so on). Multiple RFEM 6 licenses do not necessarily need to have the same add-ons. However, in this scenario, the user will not have the ability to design both timber and steel structures in the same model without access to both add-ons under the same license. If you have not purchased any of the specific add-ons (for example, steel design, timber design, and so on) for the current license, it's still possible to calculate a full analysis for this material type but design according to the standards will not be carried out.Users under the same account can easily switch to a different license within the company that includes the relevant design add-ons if no one else is currently utilizing the license."
Will there be either a network or standalone licensing configuration for RFEM 6? ,"We are pleased that RFEM 6 licensing configuration is entirely cloud based. You only need your login credentials to access the program from any computer at any location. Therefore, we will no longer offer a standalone vs. a network license which required the license manager to be installed on either a client computer or server as this was the case with RFEM 5.Additionally, the upgrade cost for an existing RFEM 5 network vs. standalone license will be the same for both. "
Will RFEM 6 have a separate Service Contract than what I’m paying now for RFEM 5? ,"RFEM 5 and RFEM 6 will have separate service contracts with the two levels Basic and Pro available for both generations. You can maintain your RFEM 5 service contract to continue receiving program updates and priority tech support. If you choose to discontinue the RFEM 5 service contract, you can continue using the program but will no longer have access to any program updates. One significant difference from the RFEM 5 service contract is that when a service contract is purchased for RFEM 6, it will also be required to purchase a service contract for each add-on. The reason for this is you now have access to all national and international standards for a given material (e.g. concrete design acc. to ACI 318, CSA A23.3, EC2, etc. in one add-on). Program updates will include significant updates for the add-ons including the addition of new standards when available. It’s highly suggested that a service contract is purchased for RFEM 6 as significant development will continue over the next several years for this new generation and will be provided through program updates to those with a valid service contract. Both the Basic and Pro levels will provide access to the latest program updates while the Basic will provide priority email technical support only and the Pro will provide priority email, phone, and screen-sharing technical support. "
I want to continue using RFEM 5. Are you going to stop supporting this version now?,We anticipate that RFEM 5 and RFEM 6 will have a ~2-year overlap period. This means we will continue to fully support RFEM 5 during this time including providing updates to fix any program issues along with priority tech support for those with a valid service contract. All new features and development will be integrated in RFEM 6 though. You can continue to use your RFEM 5 normally during this time period until there comes such a time in the future where we will move our development and tech support entirely to RFEM 6. 
Do I have to upgrade to RFEM 6 right away? ,"You do not need to immediately upgrade to RFEM 6. We will continue to support RFEM 5 entirely which includes fixing any program issues with new updates and providing priority tech support for those with a valid service contract over what we expect to be a ~2-year overlap period. Therefore, you can choose to upgrade to RFEM 6 now, or you can choose to upgrade several months from now. "
"If I upgrade an RFEM 5 design add-on module, which codes or standards will I have access to in RFEM 6? ","When you upgrade an RFEM 5 add-on module such as RF-STEEL AISC, you will now have access to all national and international standards in RFEM 6 including AISC 360, CSA S16, EC3, and many more. The separate standards under each design material are no longer sold as separate modules. If you currently have multiple modules for the separate standards (e.g. RF-STEEL AISC and RF-STEEL CSA), there will only be one upgrade fee for a material family. This will be a long-term cost savings. "
"If I have multiple RFEM 5 licenses including multiple add-on modules, do I have to upgrade them all at the same time? ","It’s not required to update all RFEM 5 licenses and add-on modules at once. You can begin by upgrading only one RFEM license and add-on modules if you prefer. Over time, you can slowly upgrade your additional licenses. "
Will I lose access to RFEM 5 when I upgrade to RFEM 6?,"If you have outright purchased your license, you will not lose access to RFEM 5 even after upgrading. Instead, we will now provide you with a separate license for RFEM 6. This means that two engineers can be working in both RFEM 5 and RFEM 6 at the same time. RFEM 5 can continue to be used indefinitely. "
How much does it cost to upgrade to RFEM 6 if I own a current license of RFEM 5? ,"There are separate upgrade fees for both RFEM 5 and the add-on modules that you currently own. The RFEM 5 upgrade fee is a set price while the add-on module upgrades vary. There will only be one upgrade fee for multiple standards within the same material family. For example, if you currently own a seat of RF-STEEL AISC and RF-STEEL CSA, there is only one upgrade fee for both add-on modules, which you will now have access to steel design in RFEM 6 according to the AISC, CSA, EC3, and all other international standards. These add-ons now include all national and international standards in one product which will be much more cost effective. For an itemized quote specific to your current RFEM 5 products, please contact us as we are happy to put this together for you."
Can I upgrade to RFEM 6 or RSTAB 9 for free with my current RFEM 5 or RSTAB 8 service contract?,To upgrade from RFEM 5 to RFEM 6 or RSTAB 8 to RSTAB 9 will require an upgrade fee which is not covered under your existing RFEM 5 / RSTAB 8 Basic or Pro Service Contract.Visit the webshop to learn more about upgrade options or contact our sales team today for your customized quote.
How do I apply wind load on members of open structures?,"1. Define a plane that will be used to apply the wind load. You can do so by creating 4 corner nodes around your structure.2. Go to Tools → Generate Loads → From Area Loads on Members via Planes. Define the direction, magnitude, and Select Empty, On Members Only. Select the corner nodes that were previously created.3. Select Settings for load generation to adjust the tolerance type. Select Absolute via distance and enter a value that will capture the entire width/length of the structure. Click OK twice to exit.4. Right click on the area load and select Display Separately. The area load is now displayed as member loads.Note: The applied load is based on the member orientation."
I encountered a sharing violation while importing a dxf file into SHAPE‑THIN. What is the issue?,The dxf file is currently being used by another program such as CAD. Close the file and import the file again.
Is it possible to export RWIND Simulation results into a GIS software or any other external program? ,"RWIND Simulation results are stored as a VTK format (.vtp and .vtu files) located in the working directory of the project. The files can be opened in ParaView which is an open source software available at https://www.paraview.org. The data can be further exported to many other formats. Because ParaView is an open source software and allows the use of custom plugins, it is possible to export data to any custom format. For more information on ParaView, refer to FAQ 4825."
How can I model a thickened area of my concrete slab in RFEM such as a drop panel?,"Yes, this is possible and can be done by adding in an opening in the slab and then place a thicker slab within the opening. Then the column would connect to this thicker slab along with an average region and FE mesh refinement to eliminate singularities. This can be designed within the RF-CONCRETE Surfaces add-on module. The punching shear design module RF‑PUNCH Pro does not have the ACI or CSA standards implemented so the solution above is an alternative to this."
How can I determine the controlling internal forces at a node that several members frame into for connection design?,"Although member end forces are typically used for connection design (see FAQ 4918 linked below), there may be the scenario that you're interested in the total internal forces at a particular node where several members are framing into this point at various angles. The program does not give internal force result information at nodes by default. The best option is to create a result beam where you can select which members to consider for the internal force summation. Result beams do not add any stiffness to the model and are used purely as a result interpretation tool (see KB 1406 linked below). You can view internal forces on result beams as you would any other member which the member end force can provide the force summary at a particular node. Please note, result beams internally create a perpendicular plane at each point along the member length and at both ends to determine which forces shall be integrated in the results. This works well for all elements which do not lie directly in the perpendicular plane to the result beam. For any elements that are directly perpendicular, a very small offset must be applied to the element so it's no longer perfectly perpendicular for the result beam to also capture its results. "
My member is oriented at the inclination of principal axis when I import from SHAPE-THIN to a 2D RFEM model. How do I fix this?,"In the General Data, change the Type of Model from 2D to 3D. This will automatically adjust the member orientation to its geometric axis."
Is it possible to model and design tapered castellated beams in RF-STEEL AISC?,"In RFEM, built-up sections called Castellated Beams are available in the cross-section library. They allow you to place openings in the web of sections such as W-shapes for example. The layout of the openings is parametric where the diameter and spacing can be adjusted. These cross-sections can further be designed in the RF-STEEL AISC add-on module. You can then set separate cross-sections for the start and end of the member allowing you to create a tapered section. "
"My section is classified as Class 4 and non-designable in RF-/STEEL CSA. However, my manual calculation shows a different class. Why the difference?","The maximum b/t and h/w ratios are based on Table 1 or Table 2 depending on the internal forces in the members. For members subject to pure axial compression, Table 1 is used. For members subject to flexure or flexure+axial (beam-column), Table 2 is used.In RFEM, the preset setting is to neglect the bending moment if the ratio is less than 1%. Therefore, the program shows “Class 4” since the check is based on Table 1.To change this setting, go to Details and set the limit values to zero. By doing so, the program runs the check per Table 2 and no longer ignore the small moments.Note: In the example model, where moments are zero at the support locations, the result is still shown as “Class 4 (non-designable)”."
Why are my steel members not being designed for stability in RF-STEEL AISC?,"Curved members cannot be designed for stability within the RF-STEEL AISC module. These stability checks include flexural buckling (strong axis and weak axis) and flexural torsional buckling according to Chapter E. Lateral torsional buckling is also not checked according to Chapter F for these types of members. A possible workaround to carry out stability design for a curved member is to convert the line element to a polyline and design as a straight member instead. Alternatively, a series of straight line segments can be modeled and convert to a set-of-members which can also be designed in the RF-STEEL AISC module including stability checks. "
"After installing SHAPE-THIN, I receive Error 1000: Error in Material Library. How do I resolve this? ","The first option is to reinstall the program. When you begin the reinstallation, you will be prompted to uninstall the existing version. Confirm the uninstallation then begin reinstallation of the program. The second option is to manually integrate the already existing material libraries from either a previous version of the program that exists on your computer or another computer where the program is installed. The following files located under C:\ProgramData\Dlubal\SHAPE-THIN\General Data from the existing version can be copied into the version with the missing material database. General material library: 'Materialien.dbd' User-defined material library: 'Materialien_User.dbd'"
"In RF-/TIMBER AWC and RF-/TIMBER CSA, I receive the error that says torsion limit exceeded. How do I bypass this error message?","Torsion design is not specified in ANSI/AWC-NDS and CAN/CSA O86. It is possible to ignore shear stresses due to torsion if a user-defined ratio of the torsional shear resistance is not exceeded (default: 5%). If the limit is exceeded, a note appears in the result window. This limit setting is not part of the Standard. Changing the limit is the responsibility of the user. It is also possible to completely ignore torsion.In the add-on modules RF-/TIMBER AWC and RF-/TIMBER CSA, go to 'Details' to modify the torsion design. "
Is it possible to set user-defined values when viewing solid stress results?,"No, it is not possible to set user-defined values when viewing stress results on a solid. These unfortunately do not work like results on a surface. It is possible to activate the result values on each FE Mesh Node using the settings shown below under Values on Surface. To access the filter settings you must right click on the label ""Values on Surfaces."" You can then also set your results to Solid Point Display under the Results menu. This will help give a better visual on where those results are located graphically. "
Is there the ability to apply the adjusted wind tunnel dimensions in RWIND Simulation for all wind load cases instead of making the revision manually for each load case?,"Currently, there is not the available option to apply the manually adjusted wind tunnel dimensions to all wind load cases. This option is currently in development for a future update release."
What is the optimal wind tunnel size in RWIND Simulation?,"The suggested default wind tunnel dimensions of the intake size are set to twice the width and height dimensions of the model. Its length is set as three times the model length with a shorter distance at the intake side. The procedure used to calculate the default wind tunnel dimensions involves a complex testing process that has been optimized. The default dimensions are determined as to provide sufficiently large free space around the structure in the model, and also set as small as possible to obtain short calculation times. Although the automatic default dimensions should be sufficient, manual changes can be made by the user. "
How can I get the member end forces to design the connections?,"After running a calculation, you can view the member internal forces under Table 4.6 Members - Internal Forces. The tools at the top of the table include a filter function. Under the detail setting for the filter, you can turn on/off the internal force values for the start of members, internal points, or end of members. For connection design, the start of members and end of members will be most of interest. This information can additionally be exported to Microsoft Excel with the direct link in the table options. For additional information on the filter options, refer to the RFEM Online Manual 11.5.5 Filter Functions."
"How do I display the load combination description according to an action category, such as ""D, L, W"" instead of ""LC1, LC2, LC3""?","In the Program Options menu, under Program tab, you can check the ""Combination description according to action category"" to display ""D, L, W"" instead of ""LC1, LC2, LC3."""
"The TIMBER Pro add-on module seems to multiply the shear stress by 1.5. However, the Eurocode does not specify any additional factor. How do you explain this difference?","The shear stress of your cross-section may be the average value. The distribution of the shear stress is not constant, however, but parabolic with its maximum in the shear center.Note that the maximum shear stress of a rectangular section is about 50% higher than the average stress. "
How can I design dowel-laminated timber (DLT) or nail-laminated timber (NLT) in RFEM?,"Both DLT and NLT are considered to behave more like single-axis beam elements stressed primarily in bending. Although realistically there is a small amount of stiffness perpendicular to the span direction, this is neglected in beam design. This is in contrast to cross-laminated timber (CLT) which includes two-way stiffness in both the directions parallel and perpendicular to the span direction. Therefore, RF-LAMINATE is not the suitable add-on module to NLT or DLT design but rather used for CLT design. The best approach in RFEM is to model a standard stiffness surface with modified orthotropic elastic 2D material properties. For the material model details, the modulus of elasticity in the local y-axis direction (Ey) should be set to a very small number (i.e. 0.001). The shear modulus in the local yz-plane (Gyz) should also be set to this small value. This will replicate little to no stiffness in the direction perpendicular to the DLT or NLT span direction. The surface can then be applied in the RFEM model for the full analysis. Note, design is not possible for these elements directly in RFEM. Internal forces, stresses, deflections, etc. from the RFEM analysis can be exported to alternative programs (i.e. Excel) for further design according to the various standards."
I would expect the results from my load combination (CO) set to a linear analysis to equal the summation of the results from my load cases (LC) also set to a linear analysis. Why do the results not match?,"The reason for the difference in results between superimposing LCs in COs vs. RCs is that when you apply the loads all at once in a CO, you get a different load distribution throughout the structure than in the RC, where the results are added together. This is based on FEA, where adding all of the loading together is different compared to solving the LCs individually and adding the results together. You can compare it to a different order of operations, to put it simply. Differences in results can also be cause by nonlinear elements introduced in the model. For example, Tension Only members could be deactivated in a LC but activated in a CO because of loading changes. Keep nonlinear elements in mind when adding LCs together in a Result Combination as results of failing objects will be set to zero during the super-positioning of the individual Load Cases. This could result in unexpected results. "
How to model a cable net structure in using the RF-FORM-FINDING add-on module? ,"Because a net requires multiple cable segments to be modeled in a grid-type pattern, the cables are not one continuous member. This is not ideal for the RF-FORM-FINDING module as the cable prestress properties such as sag, target length, or force are best applied to a single cable segment. The program cannot easily apply these settings to a cable that is broken down into multiple segments along its length.The best option to model the net in RFEM is to instead use a surface element. The material and stiffness properties of the surface are the equivalent properties to that of the net provided by the manufacturer. RF-FORM-FINDING can then be applied to the surface element such as a prestress force or stress."
Does the program use different values of the modulus of elasticity for different temperatures? How do I activate them?,"Temperature-dependent stress-strain properties of an elastic isotropic material can be defined in a diagram or imported from [Excel]. These properties are considered for member and surface elements subjected to thermal load (changes or differences in temperature).The Reference temperature defines stiffnesses for the members or surfaces that have no temperature loads. For example, if a reference temperature of 300 °C is set, the reduced elastic modulus of this point of the temperature curve is applied to all members and surfaces.The Options dialog section allows you to control if the Poisson's ratios that are applied to the complete temperature diagram are identical. Clear the check box to access the Poisson's Ratio table column for individual entries.You have to select and define the Temperature/Modulus diagram on your own."
"I am using the COM interface and Grasshopper for the calculation of complex structures. For this task, I need to create NURBS lines. Could you explain how to set NURBS? For example, what kind of data should be provided for knots?","In the FAQ downloads, you will find a sample code of how to set NURBS surfaces. The knot vector KnotsX, KnotsY determines how the control points affect the NURBS curve. The number of knots is equal to the number of nodes plus the order."
Does a user-defined layer composition in RF-LAMINATE need to be shared separately with other users along with the RFEM model file or is this information stored directly in the RFEM file?,The material file needs to be saved separately within RF-LAMINATE and then shared with another user if they would like to access the user-defined compositions or custom layups. The additional user will then need to open the .jyr file that was shared within RF-LAMINATE directly. 
Does RFEM integrate with Autodesk Inventor? ,"RFEM can communicate with Autodesk Inventor in a limited way. Inventor reads and writes volumetric and geometric information similar to .IFC coordination view files. A .STEP file can be exported from this program. RFEM can then import such files in the BIM/CAD Model with the additional module RF-LINK. Alternatively, any CAD program has the ability to export .DXF files which allow RFEM to read center line information. This is not a full solution and will require additional work for the user once in RFEM but does not require any addition add-on modules. Lastly, a user can utilize RF-COM/RS-COM to develop a process to read any CAD software into RFEM/RSTAB through an open API interface. "
How do I display nodal displacements graphically?,"To display nodal displacements graphically, activate the ""Nodal Displacements"" setting in the Display Navigator under Results - Deformation. In the Results Navigator, turn on Global Deformations. The nodes can then be highlighted and isolated by using ""Views By Selected Objects"" for a better view of the nodes and displacements. "
Can silos/tanks be exported from RFEM to Revit?,"Yes, this is possible. Silos/tanks are usually made up of one curved 2D surface. This 2D surface needs to be split into two separate 2D surfaces for the cylinder to be exported into Revit. If it is only made up of one surface, then only half of the cylinder will be exported.To do this, create a cylinder with one single surface. Then draw a line exactly adjacent to the original line that was created perpendicular to the top and bottom of the cylinder. Next, delete the surface and recreate two surfaces using the quadrangle tool. This process is also demonstrated in the attached video."
"Are ""rib"" elements considered with Revit to RFEM integration? ","Rib elements are not considered for either the import or export option with REFM to Revit. Ribs are converted to ""beam"" elements in either scenario. The eccentricity is applied, but it is not listed as a rib element and does not include integrated widths. "
Is it possible to also have RFEM output the area of each finite element along with its location?,"There is no option for viewing the FE mesh nodes in RFEM along with those areas, but it is possible to export them to an Excel sheet. The coordinates of the FE mesh nodes are exported to Excel. It is also possible to export the FE mesh as a .dxf file into AutoCAD. To do so, use the direct export option in RFEM and select the FE Mesh option. Another option is to go to File - Export and then select the following format. Then, in the Geometry tab, select the check boxes shown below. "
Which stresses are most important for glass design consideration when using RF-GLASS? ,"Glass design is typically controlled by the tension stresses. For the tension stress components, σx, σy, σ1, and σ2, the design ratio is determined with regard to the limit stress. If the limit stress is not exceeded, the ratio is less than or equal to 1, and the stress analysis is satisfied. The ratio is calculated only for positive (tension) stress values, σx, σy, σ1, and σ2, because the tension stiffness σlimit,d is governing for glass. The table describes the calculation of the ratios. For unique or special glass design projects (i.e. glass beams, glass stairs, etc.), additional stresses other than tension may be important for design consideration."
"When I try to export/import a model between RFEM and Rhino, I get an error regarding RF‑COM. ""Export Error: Error to write data, message: The demo version of RF‑COM allows models with a maximum of 12 members, 2 surfaces, and 2 solids only"". How do I fix this?","Download the following link: http://www.dlubal.de/download/temp/Rhino_Com_patch.zip Then: (1) Please close RFEM and Rhino.(2) Open the ZIP folder and double click the *.rhi file.(3) Select the ""Anyone who uses this computer"" option in the Rhino Package Installer.

I have a 4K display. Fonts and icons are extremely small in addition to dialog boxes being cut off within RFEM. How can I fix this?,"The dialog boxes in the Dlubal Software programs are optimized for a display scale of 100% in the control panel settings of the computer itself. The problem can be corrected if you change the scale settings in the Control Panel to ""Recommended"" or/and a higher resolution. Another option is to deactivate the high DPI scaling values. To do this, open the Properties of the program by right-clicking on the program icon. Under the Compatibility tab, check the box for ""Override high DPI scaling behavior. Scaling performed by:"" and select ""System"" from the drop-down box. Then accept the change, confirm changes, and restart RFEM if it is left open. "
Can RF‑STEEL AISC optimize cross-sections for serviceability?,"The RF‑STEEL AISC module does not optimize cross-sections for the Serviceability Limit State design. Optimization is only calculated for the Ultimate Limit State design. Users must manually adjust the cross-section in RFEM or within the add-on module and can export the cross-section back into RFEM. In either scenario, the model must be rerun in order to calculate the correct internal forces with adjusted member size. "

"In RF-/TIMBER AWC and RF-/TIMBER CSA, I receive the Error 49927 and Error 54089 respectively which says the cross-section is not permitted. Why can I not design this section in the add-on module?","In the add-on modules RF‑/TIMBER AWC and RF‑/TIMBER CSA, only rectangular and round cross-sections can be designed at this time. We are looking to expand the cross-section design capabilities in a future release similar to what the RF‑/TIMBER Pro add-on module allows according to Eurocode. Therefore, design should be done manually for these types of cross-sections according to the NDS or CSA standards."
What is the formula used to calculate the ASCE 7 wind velocity profile?,"The wind velocity profile in RWIND Simulation according to the ASCE 7‑16 standard [1] is calculated based on Eq. 26.10‑1. The coefficients and basic wind speed in this equation below are incorporated in the wind pressure equation. Velocity wind pressure (imperial): qz = 0.00256 Kz Kzt Kd Ke V^2 We must reference this equation to calculate the inlet velocity relative to elevation for the RWIND Simulation CFD wind tunnel. To consider only velocity rather than pressure from this equation, the basic wind speed is multiplied by the square-root of each coefficient. Notice the velocity variable in Eq. 26.10‑1 is squared which requires the square root of the coefficients to be considered. $Inlet\;velocity\;=\;V\sqrt{K_e\;\cdot\;K_{d\;}\cdot\;K_z\;\cdot\;K_{zt}}$ Because the ASCE 7-16 standard does not address wind CFD analysis and magnitude of the required inlet velocity, it is difficult to draw comparisons. Therefore, this is the closest estimate for calculating the RWIND Simulation inlet wind velocity per the code. "
Can RF‑TIMBER AWC optimize cross-sections for fire design?,"The RF‑TIMBER AWC add-on module does not optimize cross-sections for the serviceability limit state or the fire resistance design. Optimization is only calculated for the ultimate limit state design. Users must manually adjust the cross-section in RFEM or within the add-on module and can export the cross-section back into RFEM. In either scenario, the model must be rerun in order to calculate the correct internal forces with the adjusted member size."
"When trying to import a model from AutoCAD into RFEM, I am getting the error message ""3DSOLID or REGION entity detected. Those entities are written in binary format, so import is not possible.""What does this mean?",The reason this warning appears is because it is not possible to import 3D solids into RFEM from AutoCAD. Only 1D and 2D members can be imported in from AutoCAD to RFEM. The reason for this is because only line elements can be imported so with 3D solids they could not be automatically generated. 
"Is it possible to perform automatic live load reduction in RFEM or RSTAB per the ASCE, IBC, or NBCC?",Live load reduction is not considered automatically in RFEM. RFEM and RSTAB are general FEA and framework programs. The program does not understand what is a floor element vs. wall element. Only a general plate element is defined. It is not possible for the program to determine the area of a floor for live load reduction. A user must manually consider the reduction by modifying the live load magnitude directly in the load application. 
"In RF-/DYNAM PRO - Forced Vibrations, why does my time diagram function formula output incorrect values which appear to be off by only a factor? ","In the Dlubal programs, all values are stored internally based on SI units. When a user changes the units in the program to metric or imperial, SI units are still used internally and only the value displayed in the interface is modified. Therefore, all values set in the time diagram function also default to SI units unless the user clarifies an alternative unit. Let's look at a simple example the parameter x = 1 ft has been set in RFEM. In RF‑DYNAM Pro - Forced Vibrations, the time diagram function is defined as k(t) = 1*x where 1 is the multiplier (1/ft) to convert x to a dimensionless value. Because all values default to SI units, the Multiplier column produces values of 0.305 instead of the correct value of 1.000. In order to correct the issue, the user only needs to specify the units of the multiplier as (1/ft) in the function equation. This can be done with the formula modification k(t) = 1/1[ft]*x . Notice the Multiplier column now shows the correct values of 1.000. In summary, when using units in the program other than SI units, coefficients or multipliers in the time diagram function should be accompanied with alternative units defined in brackets. "
RFEM shows a warning message saying that the intersection is not defined correctly. How can I avoid this?,"This warning might be caused by overlapping surfaces, which may occur when modelling one solid to another, for example. In order to avoid the overlapping surfaces, an opening is required here. After defining the opening, also check if the definitions of the solids have to be corrected."
"When trying to calculate the design in RF‑STEEL Surfaces, I receive Warning No. 1162 - Surface No. XX is of the type ""Orthotropic"" and cannot be designed. What does this Warning mean?","Orthotropic surfaces are non-linear and cannot be designed within the RF‑STEEL Surfaces add-on module. It is possible to get a full stress analysis in RFEM for the orthotropic surfaces defined with the orthotropy type ""constant thickness"" and compared to limiting stresses manually. For all other orthotropy type, the program is not aware of the geometric properties for the surface at every FE mesh point which is needed to calculate stresses. An extensive and detailed FE model would need to be created. See FAQ 2468 for an example of this. Surface types need to be set to ""standard"" to be designed within the add-on module. "
"After running the design in RF‑STEEL AISC, I receive error message 1002 - Invalid cross-section of type ""Channel"" according to F2. What does this error mean?",Section F2 out of the AISC 360‑16 [1] states that doubly symmetric I-Shapes and Channels that are bent about their major axis must be compact sections in order to be designed. An example of this can be seen below. Non-compact sections cannot be designed according to F2. 
Is the Gust-effect (G or Gf) from the ASCE 7‑16 Sect. 26.11 considered in RWIND Simulation?,"Yes, the Gust-factor G or Gf, can be adjusted in RWIND Simulation. This value can be changed within the ""Wind load"" tab under ""Wind velocity."" In the ASCE 7-16, the conservative value for the Gust-factor, G, is 0.85 for rigid buildings. The engineer can calculate an alternative and more accurate value. The Gust-effect, Gf, for flexible buildings accounts for size and gust size similar to rigid buildings, but also considers dynamic amplification including wind speed, natural frequency, and damping ratio. "
Will other standards be added to the wind profile generation options in RWIND Simulation?,Additional standards and codes to generate the wind profile automatically in RWIND Simulation will be added in the future. We are always considering feedback from our current customers on which standards will be beneficial. 
Does software RWIND Simulation account for the internal pressure coefficient (GCpi) from the ASCE 7‑16?,"The internal pressure coefficients do not need to be considered with in the RWIND Simulation program. RWIND Simulation always outputs the net pressure on the surfaces in RFEM. When it comes to a simulation with a building that has open windows in RWIND Simulation, there is an internal pressure acting on the inside of the building. The program uses this information to determine the resulting pressure based on the external and internal surfaces. A comparison cannot be made between this coefficient in the standard and a CFD calculation because there is no direct correlation. "
Does the software RWIND Simulation consider the wind directionality factor (Kd) from the ASCE 7‑16?,The wind directionality factor (Kd) from the ASCE 7‑16 Sect. 26.6 is considered in the ASCE 7‑16 wind load profile or RWIND Simulation calculation and can be adjusted manually by the engineer. The wind directionality factor (Kd) can be considered in RWIND Simulation by modifying the factor under the wind velocity profile settings before running RWIND Simulation in RFEM. This factor for various structure types can be determined from table 26.6‑1 from the ASCE 7‑16 [1].
"Are the Revit and Tekla models that you've shown in ""Webinar 3: BIM Integration and RFEM"" available for free use and can you send them to me?","Yes, the data is freely available. You can find the structures in the download section of this FAQ."
"What happens if I activate the ""Soil failure"" function in RF‑SOILIN?","The zero coefficient of structural soil strength can be used for better convergence of deeper excavations or small loading. Damaged soil has no structural soil strength. Therefore, it is better to model the damaged subsoil in the upper layers with this function. The possible entry for the depth of the soil failure is from 0.0 m to 1.0 m."
"When designing seismic equivalent loads with a Response Spectra Analysis (RSA) in RFEM, how can I apply the modal response parameters Ie/R according to Sect. 12.9.1.2 in the ASCE‑7‑16 to my results?","The modal response parameters can be set in the RF‑DYNAM Pro - Equivalent Forces add-on module under the Response Spectra tab. In the Code Parameters table → Type of Spectrum → Modal Response Parameters, the default is set to ""No Modification"". Changing this to ""Force Related"" in the drop-down window will divide the response spectra by Ie/R based on Sect. 12.9.1.2 [1]. Additionally, in the Code Parameters table > Coefficients, the Seismic Importance Factor (Ie) and the Response Modification Factor (R) can further be set. "
How would you best model hold down elements within panels?,"In a short overview, creating hold down elements involves modeling rigid links and adding in nodal supports with non-linearity settings that allows the supports to take only tension forces. A line support is added at the bottom of the wall that only takes compression forces. The individual nodal supports connected with rigid members only take tension forces. A more detailed look on how these elements can be model can be seen in the video below. "
"How can I change the size of reinforcement bars from the American code (#3,#4, and so on) to millimeters in RF‑CONCRETE Members while using ACI?","You will find the corresponding option under ""Settings"" of the add-on module."
"""During the calculation of material non-linearity, the material with a decreasing branch of the diagram can be calculated with one load increment only."" Why do I get this error?","Only the default setting of 1 load increment can be set when a complex nonlinear material model is defined. The reason for this is because the program cannot determine the correct material stiffness for each incremental loading amount. The exact maximum load needs to be applied to the structure in order to determine the state of the material's stress/strain diagram. This setting can be found and changed under ""Calculation Parameters"" as well as under the ""Calculation Parameters"" in the load cases and combinations dialog box. "
Does RF‑STEEL AISC perform torsion design per Design Guide No. 9?,"Yes, the AISC module will detect if there are bending or torsional forces on a member and design accordingly per Design Guide 9. The add-on module combines the shear stresses due to bending and axial loads calculated by RFEM and shear stresses calculated using St. Venant's Torsion to make design checks per Design Guide No. 9. The Steel AISC module also has the option under ""Details"" to activate the RF‑STEEL Warping Torsion add-on module extension where a nonlinear warping torsion analysis is performed using 7 degrees of freedom. Normal and shear stresses on the member are independently determined from the AISC Design Guide No. 9. The loading used in this extension is taken directly from RFEM for analysis. "
I cannot get my members exported from RFEM to TEKLA. What am I doing wrong?,"If you are using members with cross-sections that are not known by the interface, you should use the conversion file for the cross-sections. This mapping file can be easily filled with the names of the cross-sections. In the left column of the table, write the names of the cross-sections used in TEKLA, and in the right column, write the DLUBAL names or select them from the library.Please watch the attached video. Note: In TEKLA, you have to have the right environment. In the video, Chinese cross-sections should be transferred, so the Chinese environment has to be used in TEKLA."
"How can I obtain internal forces, calculated in CRANEWAY, for a special x-location?","In CRANEWAY, the internal forces are usually displayed for the max and min locations only. If you want to obtain all internal forces on all x-locations, you have to run a detailed calculation and to disable the ""Show only governing results"" option. The short video shows how to do it."
RF‑STEEL AISC add-module shows non-designable results for general cross-sections because of shear buckling checks according to Chapter G. How do I solve this?,"When designing general cross-sections in the RF‑STEEL AISC add-on module, a ""Non-designable"" message is given for the design ratio. General cross-sections are defined in the program as user-defined sections or shapes which are not included in the specification. Though, some user-defined cross-sections can be designed under specific conditions. The warning message is displayed because shear buckling is not provided for general cross-section in the AISC 360‑16 [1] Chapter G. More info on this topic can be found in the RF‑STEEL AISC manual linked below. This warning can be turned off in RF‑STEEL AISC add-on module under the ""Details"" button → Shear Buckling → ""Shear buckling warning for general cross-section."" "
Why is it always displayed during the calculation that the program performs a nonlinear analysis? ,"Even if the program does not calculate a nonlinear material, it may calculate a nonlinear algebraic equation according to the second-order or large deformation analysis. Therefore, the design is not only nonlinear because of the geometrical material nonlinearities, but also because of the nonlinear physical analysis method.The attached video shows that if the nonlinear behavior of the tension beam is not considered during the calculation, a linear analysis is displayed in load cases and a nonlinear analysis is displayed in load combinations. The reason for this is the nonlinear design according to second-order analysis in the load combination. "
It seems that the members stay not deformed after my RF‑FORM‑FINDING calculation. What did I wrong?,"The deformation of members is shown as single colored lines by default. Please show them as colored cross-sections. It is also always a good idea to decrease the Display factor for the deformation to 1.0, otherwise the results might be misinterpreted."
How can I add small members perpendicular to a surface?,There are a lot of possibilities to define a member to a surface. One is to move the surface with a small amount out of the original plane and add a coupling on it. The workflow is demonstrated in the video. 
"When I import an .stp file into RFEM, a lot of unused nodes appear. How can I avoid that? ","In the Detail dialog box of the import file, it is possible to select Angles instead of Nodes. If this is checked, the unused nodes should not occur."
I need to define different types of lateral intermediate restrains for a single element in RF-/STEEL EC3. Is this possible?,"If you need to define different types of lateral intermediate supports, it is necessary to divide the specific member. After that, you can create a set of member and with that done, you can easily define different types of intermediate supports along this set of member, or you can use different nodal supports in the nodes of the set of member."
"After running a time history analysis, I am not able to see all results on surfaces. Is there a possibility to show them?","In the results of the RF‑/DYNAM Pro add-on module, ""Basic Internal Forces"" and ""Basic Stresses"" on surfaces are only provided. However, you can use the option to export the results in a result combination to display all results after the time history analysis. Simply use this option to create a result combination in the add-on module, and show the results in the graphic. All results, such as ""Design Internal Forces"" or ""Stresses,"" are available then."
Is it possible to generate an FE-mesh with elements that have more than four nodes?,"No, unfortunately that is not possible. A finite element can only have three or four nodes. For further information regarding the basics of finite elements in RFEM, please take a look at our RFEM Manual, Chapter 7.2.1 - Basics of Finite Elements in RFEM. "
What is the easiest way to define a polygonal surface graphically?,"Basically, there are two options:If no structural lines are defined yet, a polygonal surface can be defined by menu bar → ""Insert"" → ""Model Data"" → ""Surfaces"" → ""Plane"" → ""Graphically"" → ""Polygon"", If structural lines are already defined, a polygonal surface can be defined by menu bar → ""Insert"" → ""Model Data"" → ""Surfaces"" → ""Plane"" → ""Graphically"" → ""Select Boundary Lines"""
"When calculating a result combination, I receive the ""Warning No. 30014 – Incorrect addition of load cases in the result combination! The result combination contains load cases or load combinations with results containing second-order effects, which points towards nonlinear relationships and therefore cannot be added together..."" What does this warning mean?","This warning appears in the case of the following result combination definitions when the load cases/load combinations are analyzed according to a nonlinear analysis, such as the second-order or large deformation analysis.Case 1: RC = LC1/CO1 + LC2/CO2For Case 1, load cases/load combinations cannot be superimposed together in a result combination when each case/combination is ran according to a nonlinear analysis such as a second-order (P-Delta, p-delta) or large deformation analysis. Deformations in both load cases are based on different structural systems and will result in incorrect results as P-Delta effects cannot be simply added together.The solution for this case is to either run the load cases/load combinations according to a geometrically linear analysis, where the results can be superimposed together in a result combination, or the consideration of the combined load cases must only be considered under the Load Combinations tab and evaluated individually rather than in a result combination. Keep in mind, this same warning will appear when creating a result combination in a model where geometric nonlinearities are also defined. An example includes a slab foundation where a nonlinear surface support is defined to fail in the case of uplift. Geometric nonlinearities can accurately be considered in load combinations opposed to result combinations which may yield incorrect summary results.Case 2: RC = Factor* LC1/CO1 or Factor* LC2/CO2For Case 2, if a load case/load combination is calculated according to a nonlinear analysis, it is not possible to additionally apply a factor to the result combination. The factor would not only be applied to the defined loads on the structure, but also to the nonlinear effects such as P-Delta which is incorrect.The solution for this case is to either run the load cases/load combinations according to a geometrically linear analysis, where the factor can be applied to the result combination, or the factor can be considered under the Load Combinations tab, where it will be applied directly to load cases according to a geometrically linear analysis only, without consideration to the second-order effects."
My structure is unstable. How can I identify the location of the instability?,"After the calculation is aborted due to the instability, there will be shown a window with ""Calculation Errors and Messages"". For each displayed message, you can see a yellow arrow on the screen which will guide you to the location of the instability. In most cases, the error message contains also a FE mesh node number. FE mesh nodes can be found also by using the menu ""Edit"" → ""Find via Number"". "
"In RF‑/DYNAM Pro, I get the error No. 1759: ""The Microsoft Excel Worksheet 'Acceleration Data' was not found."" What could be the reason?","The reason for this error message is the wrong title of the Excel sheet. The sheet with the acceleration data should be named ""Acceleration Data"" so that the module knows in which sheet the data is contained."
The RF‑CONCRETE Members add-on module is calculating a very high required reinforcement to fulfil the requirements of the SLS checks. Is there any way to avoid such high values for required reinforcement?,"It is possible that the module determines a high required reinforcement for SLS if it is not possible to fit the provided reinforcement in the cross-section or rather in the reinforcement layer. It is also possible that the deflection analysis leads to high required reinforcement. Solution It could be a solution to increase the maximum number of the reinforcement layers. With a higher number of reinforcement layers, it is possible to provide a higher reinforcement. For deflection analysis, it could be a solution to disable the automatically increasing of the longitudinal reinforcement for the serviceability limit state design and to define a minimum reinforcement. In combination with other SLS checks, it could be useful to calculate the deflection analysis in a separate case. "
How can I remove the blank rows in the RFEM/RSTAB table window without deleting every single row?,"In order to remove the blank rows in the table and avoid deleting every single row, it would be reasonable to use the ""Renumber"" tool: Select all corresponding objects, such as lines, nodes, surfaces, by using the Views navigator, if necessary. Use the ""Renumber"" tool → ""Automatically"""
"How is Young's modulus calculated for the ""isotropic damage"" material model?",Young's modulus is calculated for each step of the defined diagram according to Hooke's law: ε = σ / EThe value of the current step is displayed beneath the diagram on the right side.
What does Error No. 12303 mean?,Error No. 12303 means that the load generated by using Tools - Generate Loads on Member does not find a member or is defined incorrectly on a certain member. You can check the generated load in Column 3.15 or by double-clicking the load. A dialog box appears where you can select corner nodes to correct the defined area.
Is it possible to assign an orthotropic direction to a solid?,"A solid can be assigned with stiffness in all three directions (x, y, z). The material model for this is named Orthtropic Elastic 3D or Orthotropic Plastic 3D.The stiffness can be defined for the modulus of elasticity and the shear modulus of the solid. The direction depends on the orientation of the solid."
Is it possible to perform a calculation in RF‑CONCRETE Members or RF‑CONCRETE Columns with the user-defined material (yield strength)?,"Yes, it is. Open Window ""1.2 Materials"" and the material library for reinforcing steel. In this material library, you can create a new ""user-defined"" material and edit the standard preset for the yield strength, for example.  Afterwards, you can select this user-defined material for design in Window 1.2 in RF‑CONCRETE Members and RF‑CONCRETE Columns. It is the same for the RSTAB add-on modules CONCRETE and CONCRETE Columns. In the settings for National Annex, there are the limits defined for the maximum value of the yield strength. To change this limit, you need to create a new user-defined national annex. "
Is there a possibility to show results only for a customized area?,"Yes, you can define an area in the panel by clicking the ""Options"" button. Here, you can define a customized area by moving the slider. In that case, the areas with higher or lower stresses have no color."
"I have split a surface, is there any way to reverse the splitting?","No, unfortunately it is not possible to reverse the splitting later on. You can use the undo function, of course, but only right after splitting the surface. Otherwise, you would have to delete the split surfaces and generate a new surface."
Which shape function is used in RFEM?,"The finite element types used in RFEM are given in the following table. They are chosen automatically by the program according to the situation. Element Type 1D beam element: element with rotational degrees of freedom 2D plate element: Lynn–Dhillon; MITC3; MITC4 – used in case of nonlinear calculation 2D wall element: with stabilized zero energy modes 2D shell element: shell element = plate element + wall element 3D solid element: element with rotational degrees of freedom; element without rotational degrees of freedom (with or without extra shape functions), gas element, contact element Integration Procedure For members, analytical integration is used for linear cases, while in the nonlinear setting the two point Gauss quadrature is used along the beam. For nonlinear cases, the following integration rule is used in the cross-section: 2×2 Gauss quadrature for quadrangles and 4-point selective reduced integration rule for triangles (3 points for 𝜖x, 𝜖y and 1 point for 𝛾xy). In plate elements, analytical integration is used whenever possible (in Lynn–Dhillon element or in a triangular element). In other cases, a 2×2 composite Gauss quadrature is used in the element plane (quadrangles). In solids, a 2×2×2 composite Gauss quadrature is used in hexahedrons. Reduced one point integration is used for some particular terms to avoid numerical problems. Let us focus on integration in plates with respect to their thickness, which is based on the Gauss–Lobatto quadrature. The Gauss–Lobatto quadrature is a Gauss quadrature in which boundary points are forced to also be integration points, which allows an exact evaluation of stresses on layer interfaces in case of multilayered plates. In case of linear calculation, three integration points are used per layer. In nonlinear calculation, nine integration points are used in the plate (nonlinear calculation allows one layer only)."
"I am having trouble changing the units from imperial to metric. Although I have selected the check box in the ""Load Profile"" dialog box, the units do not change. What did I do wrong?","It is not sufficient to only select the check box. This changes the standard settings for new files, but does not change the current file. In order to change the units, you also have to click the line so it gets highlighted. This will also change the units in the current file."
"How can I define the failure criterion s, such as Tsai-Wu, for an orthotropic material?","If you want to define the failure criterion s for an orthotropic material, you have to define the orthotropic plastic material under Material Model. The yield criterion will be taken according to the Tsai-Wu criterion. Under this link, you can find a full set of verification examples to this material model. The material model itself is explained in several technical articles of our Knowledge Base."
How do I add a member load at an angle to the member axes?,This is not possible by default. The load has to be divided into the y- and z-components. Both act simultaneously.
"When trying to run RF‑TENDON, I get the message ""The application is locked by external COM connection."" What is the problem?","RF‑TENDON is an external add-on module. While RF‑TENDON is running, RFEM is locked via the COM connection. RF‑TENDON is not integrated in RFEM and it runs as a separate application. RF‑TENDON should appear in the taskbar after it has been started."
"Is there a way to prepare an EC3 buckling check without setting the intermediate support manually, or is there a workaround that can speed this up?","Unfortunately not. Intermediate supports and nodal supports have to be set manually. The default configuration for effective lengths is 1,0*member length and for a set of members, one nodal support with the definition of u_y' and phi_x' on each side of the set of member. To speed up the process of defining nodal supports, you can pick more nodes."
How can I hide or delete background layers in RFEM and RSTAB?,"You can hide the background layers in the ""Display Navigator"". In case you want to delete any background layer, you can delete it in the ""Data Navigator"". "
"I have defined a nodal release, but it seems the internal forces are fully transferred to the released object.","Please double check if you have released the correct elements and the correct amount of elements. If you only have two beams connected to each other, please make sure you have only released one of them."
Why are the axes u and v in the member load window grayed out?,"These axes are grayed out, because the principal axes u and v are equal to the axes y and z. If there is a cross-section with the rotated principal axes, u and v become available for the selection."
"Why does the ""Calculate All"" command not calculate the results for the load cases with the ""Form-Finding"" action category?","The form-finding process in RFEM searches for shapes in equilibrium, considering the surface prestress and the given boundary conditions. The surface stress for this analysis is defined in the relevant element property definitions. The program can also consider additional loads during the form-finding calculation in the load cases defined with the ""Form-Finding"" action category. Since RFEM runs the form-finding analysis before the calculation of all other load cases and load combinations while considering the form-finding settings in the element properties and loads in the load cases with the ""Form-Finding"" action category, the calculation of the load cases with the ""Form-Finding"" category for the determined shape provides no relevant information for the structural design. The load cases with the ""Form-Finding"" category are only provided as an input for the form-finding analysis. The given loads will be ""memorized"" in the model for the form-finding calculation. Therefore, the ""Calculate All"" command neglects these special load cases with the ""Form-Finding"" category and only calculates the load cases which will be applied on the final shape of the structure. "
"When using line releases, I get an error that the definition of the release is not unique. What does that mean?","Line releases are defined by an additional line that is generated by the software. The theoretical background of line releases is described in this Knowledge Base article.For a detailed explanation of the error, see the model file attached to this FAQ. For the line release No. 3 a definition node has to be set: If the software generated an additional virtual node, Surface 2 would be destroyed.Imagine the following scenario:You have four surfaces 1, 2, 10, 14. When you define a line release to Line 3. As Surface 2 would be destroyed by that (as Line 6 is the same for Surface 2 and Surface 14), Line 6 has to start at Node 3 and at the generated node.This is where you need the definition node. If it is missing, the software shows the error."
I try to understand the fatigue calculations. I think these calculations are only presented folded in UC in the output document (see beneath). Is there a way to unfold the calculation?,"If you like to see the results in the printout report with all details, then please press the ""Select Topics for Printout Report"" button in the toolbar of the printout report. Now, you can select the program where you want to see the detailed results. After that, you select the ""Results"" tab and here the chapter that are you interested in. On the right side, you can open the ""Details"" menu. At least you have to enable the ""With intermediate results"" option. "
Can I use surface releases to separate two overlapping surfaces?,"You can use the surface releases, but you need to separate the overlapping part with an own surface. Overlapping surfaces should be avoided in general and can be checked by the ""Model Check"" (Tools → Model Check → Overlapping Surfaces). Please watch the video file (see the link below) to see the approach. As an alternative, you can add a ""Contact Solid"" between two surfaces."
"When trying to perform a calculation, Error Message 10996 ""File Project.EXT not found"" appears.","This error is caused by insufficient user rights in the working directory. Solution: Either you can open RFEM with the right-click and using the option ""Run as Administrator"" or assign the access rights for the working directory using Windows Explorer.
